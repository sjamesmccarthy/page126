Like any passionate project, lots of time goes into developing and designing PageOneTwentySix, which was inspired by a friend, Aimee. Thank you for making this more than just some late night text "read page 126". I have lots of things to create in the future, and yeah, I believe that "Sometimes, kismet happens". Can you tell me what book that's from? First person to direct message me @page126 on <a href="http://twitter.com/page126">Twitter</a> with the correct book title and author wins a $20 Starbucks card!
