<p class="question" style="padding-top: 10px;"><img onclick='toggle_answer('a4');' src="images/more.png" /> <a href="#a3" onclick="toggle_answer('a4');"> Are my entries secure?</a></p>
<p id="a4" class="answer">Although a simple of level encrypting entries has been built in to the application. It currently is not enabled because the long-term vision of this PageOneTwentySix is to collaborate and share. Encryption on the entry and database level would slow the process of this goal. If you would like to see us enable this please <a target="_new" href="http://twitter.com/nomoreblacktea">drop us a tweet</a>.<!-- Yes! Privacy and security were our main design factors.

<p class="question" style="padding-top: 10px;"><img onclick='toggle_answer('a5');' src="images/more.png" /> <a href="#a4" onclick="toggle_answer('a5');"> Can I import entries from a blog or my computer?</a></p>
<p id="a5" class="answer">The short answer is not yet. The long answer is there are probably too many other features that we and our community would want to see implemented first. So you are stuck with copy & paste.</p>

<p class="question" style="padding-top: 10px;"><img onclick='toggle_answer('a6');'  src="images/more.png" /> <a href="#a5" onclick="toggle_answer('a6');">Can I export my entries and journal?</a></p>

<p class="question" style="padding-top: 10px;"><img onclick='toggle_answer('a7');'  src="images/more.png" /> <a href="#a6" onclick="toggle_answer('a7');">How does the trash work? Can I take items out of it?</a></p>
<p id="a7" class="answer">The Trash works like the Trash on Mac OS X or the Recycle Bin on Windows. When viewing an entry click the Trash icon or you can delete individual entries from pages view. This will move it to the Trash, but not delete the file. When you are ready to permanently delete the file you can go to your Settings and click "Manage Journals" and then from within the specific journal click the "Empty Trash" link.</p>

<p id="a10" class="answer">This option has currently been disabled (12/31/10). We believe the creation date should be authentic. We do track and update the modification date, much like a standard text file is created and modified by your computer's operating system.</p>

<p class="question" style="padding-top: 10px;"><img onclick='toggle_answer('a11');'  src="images/more.png" /> <a href="#a10" onclick="toggle_answer('a11');">I forgot my password, what do I do?</a></p>

<p id="a17" class="answer">No, not at this time. Our road map for this will probably not be iPhone/Touch/pad specific, but responsive web as well native app.</p>

<p class="question" style="padding-top: 10px;"><img onclick='toggle_answer('a18');'  src="images/more.png" /> <a href="#a17" onclick="toggle_answer('a18');">What is a SSL certificate or https?</a></p>
<p id="a18" class="answer">Instead of trying to explain it here, read <a target="_new" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&defl=en&q=define:SSL+Certificate&ei=3EnwS7GpFIeQtgPRqZWvDw&sa=X&oi=glossary_definition&ct=title&ved=0CBwQkAE">Google's web definition</a> or the <a target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL_Certificate">Wikipedia page</a>. Typically you know that you are on a secure site when it uses https instead of http and in a nutshell it encrypts the data before transferring it from your web browser to our server.</p>

<p class="question" style="padding-top: 10px;"><img onclick='toggle_answer('a20');'  src="images/more.png" /> <a href="#a19" onclick="toggle_answer('a20');">Do you have access to the user password or secret key?</a></p>
<p id="a20" class="answer">We only have access to your PageOneTwentySix password when you enter to log in. Upon logging in your password is immediately one-way encrypted. It looks something like this: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99. We then compare that string to the one way encrypted password in our database. If the encrypted strings match we let you log in, if not, well we don't.</p>

<p id="a21" class="answer">Yes, there are some basic shortcut key options. They are only available on the writing page and all use the ctrl key (ctrl-{letter}).

<p id="a23" class="answer">We have taken extra measures to insure that content after logging in will not be googled, or spidered by a known search engine.

However there are a lot of sneaky bad bots out there and we can not guarantee this your writing will not be spidered.</p>

<p class="question" style="padding-top: 10px;"><img onclick='toggle_answer('a27');'  src="images/more.png" /> <a href="#a26" onclick="toggle_answer('a27');">Why does the SSL sometimes produce warnings?</a></p>
<p id="a27" class="answer">Rest assured our SSL certificate is valid. You check it at <a target="_new" href="http://www.digicert.com/help/?host=pageonetwentysix.com">digicert</a> <img src="/images/link.png" /> (do not use www as part of the domain name) and see for yourself, or by clicking the GoDaddy Secured icon on the <a href="?func=privacy">privacy</a> page. Mostly likely, the reason for PageOneTwentySix warnings is due to services like Google Ad Words or Facebook connecting back to their site via insecure (or http only) javascripts. Your data is still secured using SSL, it's just the web browser informing you of possible insecurities.</p>

<p class="question" style="padding-top: 10px;"><img onclick='toggle_answer('a28');'  src="images/more.png" /> <a href="#a27" onclick="toggle_answer('a28');">Why do I have to log back in after quitting my browser (session)?</a></p>
<p id="a28" class="answer">Each time that you quit your browser the session cookie is destroyed and will require you to log back in. We do this for security reasons so that if you quit your browser, leave your computer and someone else opens your browser, where you left off in pageonetwentysix.com will not display. Warning: Your session WILL NOT automatically time-out so when you are done, nor does closing the tab end your session. ALWAYS LOGOUT WHEN YOU ARE DONE.</p>

<p class="question" style="padding-top: 10px;"><img onclick='toggle_answer('a29');'  src="images/more.png" /> <a href="#a28" onclick="toggle_answer('a29');">How do I use "autosave"?</a></p>
<p id="a29" class="answer">There really is nothing to it. Simply log in to your account and create or edit an entry. Autosave automatically works for you. It triggered when moving between form fields, such as typing or editing a title and then pressing tab or clicking into the text area field. It also watches for pauses while typing in the text area and after two seconds of inactivity your entry will be saved.</p>
