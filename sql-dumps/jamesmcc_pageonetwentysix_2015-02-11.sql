In fact, it was at this exact same spot on this Hill she told me three years before. I thought about her note declaring her love and feelings for me that she handed me that windy day. The raw vulnerability of her words held close to my heart until the day she lied about everything she had written in those pages. Those words crumpled into a meaningless excuse. It was just a fling she said. Words that were crafted by the emotional loss of her child that did not mean what they said: I care for you but I don\'t love you like they read or like what I read her lips say to me that day on the hill.\n\nIt was different this time though. Today, there was no fear of consequence or talks about being controlled, or guilted into trying to make her marriage work any longer. She was in a better place this time. I could feel the peace she had finally found in her difficult decision after so many years of struggle, depression and dominance over her life. Her eyes exposed a courage that I remember the first time I had looked into them and saw our life together just as I remember that day in Colorado. \n\nHer hands slid down my side, the tender kiss coming to close, she said, \"I love you and want to be together now.\"\n\nOur connection no longer had to reach through dreams or decipher cryptic messages or hide in the shadows of our deception anymore. We stood on top the Hill this time unconstrained by the complexities of our fears -free to love at last and scream it from the mountain top if we wanted to or whisper it into each other\'s ear in bed without guilt. This time she meant it.\n\n\"Look,\" she said, pointing to a red-tail hawk circling above our heads, playing in a thermal, \"it\'s like everything is right where it\'s suppose to be now,\" watching the bird glide in circles until it perched on a rock below. \"It only took us five years,\" she said with a small chuckle, looking at my half smile, still sad for how I hurt her, \"and I know a lot of heartache,\" she said taking my hand and we started hiking back down the hill, following a narrow trail of dirt and rock that slipped under our shoes making a crunching sound.\n\n\"Hold on,\" she said. The sun was setting over the Sierra\'s to the West. I could see my old smiling face in her eyes from five years earlier.\n\n\"This is where I kissed you last time\", she said, \"do you remember?\" she asked, sliding her hands into the front pockets of my jeans like she did before.

Above the short, but long bookcase, a tv was mounted on the wall, her jewelry box and a silver necklace laid on the surface along with a family photo from last November.

Their smiles hid the exhaustive argument that had on the way to the park. A circular votive candle holder hung over the bed but never used.

She took out a small brown leather journal then pushed the box back where she kept it hidden from everyone; sometimes even herself.\n\nTossing the sheets aside, she laid down and opened the journal.\n\nAugust 14, 2009\n\"Okay, you can give me a hug,\" she said to me, looking at me warmly with eyes smiling from the inside out and a voice that I knew. Our hearts beat against each other. I didnâ€™t want to let go as our hearts made out like love-crazy teenagers, and stood there in the middle of the Subway parking lot captivated by one another until our arms fell to their sides holding hands. I glanced down and saw our fingers interlocked in a sweet yet complicated reunion, then back into her blue eyes where I am forever found. The tan line on her finger explained what she wouldn\'t tell me until I drove 1,374 miles to see her. It was too already too late because it didn\'t matter to either one of us. We had already fallen in love with no more than a hug and touch of the hand, and I knew that I wanted was to take her with me into the rest of my life. On the drive back to California she texted, \"I want to feel you inside me.\" A tease that lead to the most enjoyable drive through the Great Salt Lake. #end\n\nRemember the sexting of that day, her cheeks blushed the color of her lipstick which she hadn\'t taken off yet, bite the corner of her lower lip, touching herself in a way she also remembered him touching her on that midnight rendezvous outside the movie theater and then again in the hotel room a month later.\n\nShe turned the page, moistening her fingers and sliding them under her shorts and kept reading. The soft brush of her wet finger feeling her sensitive skin. A tickle sensation flowed through her body while she massaged herself slowly with one hand, turning pages of the journal with the other. \n\nA soft moan as her finger moved slightly faster, a light tingling sensation building as fingers became wetter and dipped into her discovering a warm, sticky pleasure. \n\nShe turned the next page.\n\nSeptember 15, 2009.\nI can\'t explain how wonderful today was. After another really long 17 hour, stop for gas and pee-break only drive she stood in front me with those angelic eyes and immediately grabbed my lips with hers. \"Do you have any music?\" she asked me. I opened the laptop on the nightstand next to me and put on the playlist she made for me: Keep Me In Your Thoughts by Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers filled the room. She stood at the foot of the bed, shoulder length blonde hair looking me in nothing but her blue panties and matching bra and seductive \"come and get me\" smile. My eyes lusting up and down her petite body as it crawled on top of me taking my lips into her mouth. She held me, hard, moving her hand, while my erection grew longer and my hand slipped under her panties feeling the warm, wet, sticky pleasure of her sex, finger sinking slowly inside her fire. She moaned and rocked her hips a few times then spun on top of me, grinding her warm, moist sex against my balls. Her boobs looked down at me filling her bra and wiggling to pop out into my hands. She rubbed down against me harder letting the tip slide inside her, slippery and warm. After a few pokes I pushed inside her, then back slowly, starting a rhythm: up and down, back and forth. She gyrated her hips whispering, \"I love how you feel inside me,\" as the sensation spread, swinging her hips back into me again. I felt the tip touch a soft pillow. It was warm, tingling, erotic. I held it there feeling the inside of wet and happy flower suck the tip the of my penis, tight, warm and hot. She squeezed her legs into my side and moaned, \"I want to feel you cum inside me,\" and I rolled on top of her. I unsnapped her bra. She wiggled it off her arms my hand cupping her squishy boobs, my thumbs circling her nipples; our mouths open and tongues tango.  We start the pattern again: left to right and up and down, and down again and slowly in and out. A sensuous tempo. The pleasure desiring to release tickled by a growing sensation from my toes to my finger tips which firmly sat on her belly, balancing me as I moved inside her somewhere in between slow and then deep and faster and then slower until her finger nails lightly ran down my shoulders and sides of my back while her soul was massaged by an exhaustive orgasm. I was about to cum and pushed deep inside her until I felt that soft, warm pillow of love surrounded by our warm release. My lips buried in her neck, feeling completely vulnerable yet totally satisfied.  She whispered, \"I love you\". #end\n\nShe slipped her hand out from under panties back over her belly and between her breasts with a self-satisfied sigh. His silhouette stood in the door watching her.\n\n\"What are you reading?\" he asked with a curiosity and stretched himself out on the bed beside her. His hand rested on top of her bare, naked leg stroking its smoothness along the inside of her thigh. She was wet and aroused from the story, sensitive to his touch. She shivered and took a long breath before returning him a seductive smile and closed the pages of the brown journal. \n\nLicking her fingers she reached through his boxers, rubbing his dick hard while circling her tongue with his and then along his lips in a long passionate kiss. His hand rushed over her belly button under her shirt grabbing her breasts, squeezing them and then down again between her legs tugging her panties from around her knees. She slid her back down the pillow flipping him and he dropped on top of her; his boxers tugged off with her feet and she opened her legs on each side of him. He easily fell inside her wet sensuous pleasure.\n\nShe moaned quietly to herself staring at the ceiling while he rocked in and out; wet, smooth, warm and fast. She put her hand on his shoulder escaping back into the memories, the words she just read while waiting for him to finish.

	(102,36,1,1,'Did you get a Fitbit or Garmin Vivosmart in your stocking this year?','Hi Ho! and Merry Christmas! TeaTimeTechTalk readers. As the morning sun softly sneaked into my bedroom window, I awoke to the silent, light-vibration of my new Garmin Vivosmart fitness band. And, what, to my wondering delight was covering the front yard, but a light dusting of Sierra snow. It was truly a magical and tech morning indeed. The Christmas tree lights all glistened and sparkled as the jingle of Santa\'s bells that I heard the eve before cross-faded into laughter and sounds of \"look-at-what-I-got\" Christmas joy.\n\nGarmin\'s Vivosmart is not your typical \"activity tracker\". In fact I think those words sell itself short and Garmin could have confidently sported the tagline: \"fitness band+\". Yes, I used a + symbol for the word plus and what earns that + is Vivosmart\'s \"smart\" notification features that includes just about anything that your iPhone would display on it\'s own notification screen but on your wrist in a 2-line preview with scroll to read more! Once the notifications are dismissed on your phone they disappear from the band.\n\nHaving used both of Fitbit\'s similar \"activity tracking\" products, the Fitbit Flex and Fitbit Charge for the past few months, as well as briefly trying on the Misfit Flash,  I am familiar with their strengths, weaknesses and goals. Without challenge, Fitbit wins the award for best in category for  software user experience. I have yet to find any activity tracker software more sexy than what Fitbit has delivered mostly on the mobile iOS and Android devices but their web site is just as simple to use for quick glancing as well as dig-into-the-data detail. It\'s pedi-cab! awesome.\n\nHowever, Fitbit\'s devices don\'t deliver the same appeal. After using the Flex and Charge for more than 30 days, both devices bands wore-out quickly. In fact I just returned my Charge after just 60 days for a worn band. Fitbit was prompt in responding to my complaint and replacing my Charge; kudos to their wonderful customer service. However, the same was true for my Flex after 30 days. The good thing about the Flex versus the Charge is at least with the Flex you can purchase new bands for about $10. The Charge band can not easily be replaced. Unfortunately, I see a pattern forming.\n\nI haven\'t owned the Vivosmart long enough to evaluate the durability of the device\'s band, but I can tell from first impressions this band is much better made and a lot more comfortable. The curve in the band and device itself is a more natural fit around  my wrist, where as both Fitbit\'s felt \"squared or flat\" when sitting on top (or bottom) of the wrist. The Vivosmart band is softer and feels more rubber than plastic. It\'s sung but not tight.  I also agree with some of the user comments I have read describing how the Vivosmart clasp (which is similar in design to the Fitbit Flex and Charge) doesn\'t feel as secure. When snapping on either the Flex or Charge you had to push pretty hard to lock in place. The Vivosmart clasp requires less pressure to secure. However, Garmin ships a handy additional band-loop to help keep the band from accidentally falling off in the event the clasp releases. I\'m not sure if this is Garmin watching the market and seeing majority of users want this or a silent acknowledgment of a problem with an in-the-box solution. Fitbit, and third-party vendors, offer a similar product for the Flex and Charge at an additional price. It\'s not a deal break in either device, unless of course it falls off your wrist during a workout and you lose it.\n\nMy favorite feature of the Viviosmart is the smart notifications. I also liked the smart caller-id on the Fitbit Charge, and honestly made me want more of that type of added value to the band. As long as you tame your notifications on the iOS side they are not overwhelming. I have not tested this with Android as it of yet. Hold on Jim, didn\'t you buy this for the \"fitness\" goal and not for a smart watch? Haha I laugh at myself, but all these step-tracking, activity-tracking bands essentially do the same thing: track steps, stairs and sleep and start/stop activities. And they do this transparently.  So you end up wearing a block of pretty colored plastic on your wrist with little or no interactive value from it unless looking at the data it has collected in real-time through the software; most likely on your phone. Garmin stepped up the game for slim lined fitness bands.\n\nWhere as after being on the Fitbit \"system\" for almost 90 days I felt their devices are not fitness focused, but dialed into a specific goal: weight-loss. Like Fitbit, the Garmin software (web and mobile) syncs up with MyFitnessPal.Com which is widely used for its incredible food database. In some ways Vivosmart better uses the MFP data, specifically, with calorie intake and activity based calorie burn. Fitbit for the most part ignores your activity calorie burn and doesn\'t added it back into your day\'s calorie budget. So if your daily calorie budget is 1,000 and you run for 30 minutes burning 300 calories, Garmin will adjust your day\'s calorie budget to 1,300 to accommodate the burn. Fitbit doesn\'t appear to do this and just subtracts calories eaten from your daily budget without an adjustment at all, which reinforces weight loss (maybe weight maintenance) as designed the primary purpose of Flex and Charge are not quite the \"fitness\" trackers that I think they need to be. Although the Charge+HR is a clear path changer for Fitbit. My question to them would be, will their software adapt? If I needed to start a fitness program to gain 5 pounds and help me increase the speed of my average biking mile I can\'t do that easily with Fitbit. And recently with Fitbit\'s public announcement to not support Apple\'s Health Kit as well the overall problems with MFP integration I would say Fitbit is quickly becoming a lone-ranger that if isn\'t willing to collaborate with others will ride itself off into the sunset.\n\nAt the end of the day, yes some of the attraction for me to the Vivosmart was the smart notifications which I think gives the band value while it\'s on my wrist. The scalability of the Garmin device platform coupled with its basic tracking abilities are also very attractive. I can quickly increase my training and fitness routine and the Vivosmart will grow with my activity.  In fact I can connect this device to other ANT+ compatible Garmin products like a heart rate monitor (electrode versus light based), bike computer or even the VIRB Elite. Imagine being able to go a hike with 3,000+ elevation gain and having your GPS, Vivosmart and heart monitor sending to data to your phone tucked safely away in your day pack and communicating that back to where it is being analyzed in real-time and possibly even shared live with friends. This is the difference between Garmin and Fitbit.\n\nWhat is your goal? fitness, weight-loss, data-junkie or just think the tech is cool? The Vivosmart is bit more pricey at $170 compared to the Fitbit Charge at $129 and the Flex at $99. It\'s closest Fitbit competitor will be the Charge+HR (to be released 2015) and that will be a $149 fitness investment.\n\nMy best recommendation is to take the time to do the research. Think about your short-term and long-term goals. Download the mobile apps and look at them (you may have to sign-up for free accounts), read the reviews and forums, make it sure syncs with other devices you want to integrate with such as MyFitnessPal.Com so that after spending a $100+ you are happy and most importantly motivated by the tech that will help you reach your goal.\n\nBryan and I here at TeaTimeTechTalk, as well as the cool musicians of Weezer who inspired and fueled this, okay, not-so-quick post \"Wish you a Merry Christmas!\"\n\nEnjoy your new toys!','',1339,'2014-12-25 12:14:16','2015-01-21 23:36:58',0,0,0),

	(78,2,1,1,'How To Break The Platinum Promise',' I drove into the office parking lot not really wanting to be here but after being forced to confess my affair I didn\'t have much of a choice. It was either leave the marriage or work it out; even if my heart really wasn\'t in it any more. Divorce is something I don\'t want to put my son through having been part of a broken family myself as well as having a mother who abandoned me. This is why I am looking for a parking spot, doing what I think is right, yet never more confused about anything in my life.\n\nCircling a few rows of cars, I finally pulled into a spot in the back where Scott could easily see me. The leaves on the trees were hanging heavy from the rain and run-off rushed like a mini river down the roads edge. It was nice to sit and watch the rain express how I felt inside.\n\nIronic, I thought, as listened to Adele\'s \"Someone Like You\" fill the interior around me. A cool mist tickled my cheek as rain spit inside from the cracked window next to me while I waited and cried and thought more about why I was here and whether I sincerely wanted to be here.\n\nSo this is what it looks like to cry from the inside I thought watching the water bead and stream down the windshield. Why am I here I kept thinking to myself. The music washing out the sound of the rain of my confusion. The song\'s lyrics soaking into my head with vivid dream-like memories of those days which I am told to forget.\n\n\"I heard that you\'re settled down / That you found a girl and you\'re married now / I heard that your dreams came true / Guess she gave you things I didn\'t give to you\"\n\nThose lyrics are right, I thought, I\'m married now, looking at my ring, turning it slightly with my thumb, thinking about the drive through the mountains with Josh and when I shared the story about how I picked the platinum wedding band of blue sapphires out myself; how I told my bridesmaid getting into the limo after the ceremony that I couldn\'t do this; how it\'s not that I love him that matters, but how -- an internal conflict of pride, guilt and submissive duty.\n\n\"Regrets and mistakes, they\'re memories made / Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?\"\n\nHis truck pulled up my beside my car. I wiped the tears and rain from my eyes and turned off Adele. We ran through the rain into the counselor\'s office.\n\nA degree in Marriage and Family Counseling hung on the wall over his desk. A country style couch with light green and blue flowers sat across from a low back, espresso colored swivel chair and side table with a yellow coffee cup and spiral notebook. He sat down with a smile and began our first counseling session.\n\nI was here in mind, as they say, but not in heart. I knew this and also knew that I had to play the game in order to stay with my son and keep Scott from getting mad. He\'s a good provider, but not a nice man when you cross him. His words often shameful and disrespectful; controlling. Scary.\n\n\"The rain is change today?\" the counselor asked smiling at us. We leaned against the sofa\'s arms, legs crossed, sitting at opposite sides. I held a pillow thinking to myself again, I have to be here for my son. He deserves the best life possible.\n\n\"How long have you two been married?\" the counselor asked, picking up his notebook from the side table. There was an awkward moment of silence of eyes staring the gray carpet.\n\n\"8 years,\" my husband finally answered. His voice, a tone of disappointment. I can\'t imagine how he felt after my betrayal, but it didn\'t feel like I was betraying him. I didn\'t really even think about it. It felt right. It felt like I had just found the person who was always missing in my life and what I was doing really didn\'t become real until that night I got the text: \"Tell him or I will.\" I realized then that I was trying to escape from something I didn\'t want to understand. My husband and I are happy, I told myself again, half aware of the continuing awkward silence of the room. I know we are happy, but I don\'t feel like on the inside; I feel alone.\n\nChristine, the counselor spoke, noticing my apparent lack of engagement in the conversation. \"There are 10 emotional needs that every marriage must meet,\" he continued, \"do you know what they are?\" I looked up from the carpet stare with a depressed smile and shook my head no. He returned an empathetic grin. The words \"let me explain them,\" followed. As he spoke I thought about each one.\n\n#1: Affection, One More Year\nHe walked over to me and leaned in for a kiss. I sighed and put one arm around him, patting his shoulder and asked \"Do you feel better now?\" He leaned back still close enough for a kiss and said, \"kiss me.\" I half-smiled and replied, \"Not today.\"\n\n#2: Sexual Fulfillment, You Suck\n\"Chloe\'s sleeping like a baby,\" he said putting his hand on my smooth, naked leg just under my shorts. \"Stop\" I thought, looking at him, moving his hand onto the sheets between us and raising my Nook in front my blue eyes, deep enlarging pupils. \"I\'m not in the mood,\" I answered and went back to reading 50 Shades of Gray.\n\n#3: Conversation, What\'s For Dinner\nWalking through the front door he made known, \"tough day at work,\" accompanied by loud footsteps down the hall and the slam of the door into the garage. The voices of Phineas and Ferb between us, standing behind me and despite my lack of interest, continued, saying, \"anyhow, I lost the blah-blah-blah account,\" shaking his head, \"I need a beer.\" I rested my blonde head on top of juniors, absorbed in his little 8 year old world while distracted by an agitated voice asking from the kitchen, \"what\'s for dinner?\" TSST, a Bud Light Platinum popping open. I looked his way answering, \"whatever, we already ate,\" kissing my son\'s head.\n\n#4: Recreational Companionship, Lake Today?\nMy beautiful body stretched down the slender couch, angelic eyes concealed behind this week\'s People Magazine. \"You didn\'t start the coffee?\" he asked, shirtless and bed-headed. \"No,\" I answered, thinking to myself, \"read between the lines dick-head,\" while listening to the coffee grinder work and kitchen drawers make a musical thudding rhythm. \"Junior and I are going to the lake today, you coming?\" he asked standing at my toes that I just finished painting purple. I put the magazine face-down on my chest and looked at him for a long second, before answering, \"No, I have errands to run today,\" and put People back in front of my angelic eyes, so I didn\'t have to look at him, adding, \"go put a shirt on will you.\"\n\n#5: Honesty and Openness, Sugar Rush\n\"I will try my best,\" I texted then deleted from my phone\'s messages app right before it vibrated again with a new message, \"do you want to meet for lunch?\" fingers paused on the slide out keyboard while I thought for a moment about how to respond back to him and then raced my fingers around the keyboard spelling it out, \"I can\'t. I have to run to Target and buy some candy for junior\'s harvest festival after school today,\" with short clicks ending on Send; fingers typing again, \"William Hughes Park 1pm. I only have a few minutes. M u.\"\n\n#6: Physical Attractiveness, Body & Mind\nI got out off bed and slipped my panties back on and I could feel him watching me. \"What?\" I asked at his naked reflection in the mirror in front of me, hard not to notice his pale gut and foolish look of thinking he doesn\'t have to worry about charming the woman he takes to bed anymore. He took my beauty for granted. I knew it and looked at myself in the same mirror, smiling, knowing another man wants to appreciate every goose bump on my smooth skin that arouses. \"I thought you were coming,\" he said patting his hand on the sheets next to him while I hooked my bra back on. \"No, I\'ve already done that,\" I smiled, rosy cheeks, \"didn\'t you even notice?\" He pulled the sheet up, covering himself, watching me finish getting dressed: gray sweats and a navy blue T-shirt and pull my hair back into pony tail. I turned around and looked at him trying to put how I felt into words: \"you are slightly more pleasurable than my vibrator.\"\n\n#7: Financial Support, Trade Off\nHis laptop screen reflected the Mastercard bill in his glasses, as he asked, \"What did you buy at Ulta?\" \"Perfume,\" I answered while crocheting on the couch. \"And, what in the world did you spend $63.27 on at Victoria\'s Secret?\" he also asked starting to sound pique. I put down my needles and yarn and lifted up my shirt, \"this bra,\" I answered, \"and what I wore to bed last night\". He sighed, lost in in a reflection of his own plight, adding \"You\'ve got to be kidding,\" head shaking at me, \"Cheesecake Factory and Teaz and Pleaz?\", sigh, \"What are you thinking?\" Again, I looked up and answered \"cheesecake and a little fun,\" with a devilish grin, \"do you want play with it too?\". \"No,\" he replied with a short irk, \"When we decided you\'d stay home with junior and quit your job I thought we had an agreement no more spending like we had two incomes. I work hard for this money\" he implored with a cold stare in my direction. Tired of his grumbling I replied \"I\'m going back to work.\" His stare became frustrated and I finished by reminding him it was his turn to do the laundry this weekend.\n\n#8: Domestic Support, Roommates\nThe Saturday morning sun glinted through the half open blinds across an unmade bed. The steam after two showers filled the room a soft, misty fog. \"I thought we would run to Costco and then pack the boat up for winter after lunch,\" he said, still wrapped in a towel, looking for a t-shirt, asking, \"I thought you were going to hang these up yesterday.\" Slipping on my cycling shorts I answered, \"I\'m not your mother.\" He exhaled loudly and mumbled, \"What the hell do you do all day?\" Thinking I didn\'t hear him, but I did and I thought about how I went and left a bag of Reese\'s Pieces on a doorstep, scratched a heart on a wooden bridge in the park and picked up my son. \"I\'m going to the park for a bike ride,\" I said, ignoring his comments, and on the way out of the bedroom, I turned around adding, \"Also, make the bed after putting away your clothes.\" Walking down the hall, I spoke loudly, so I knew he would hear, \"like you did before I said I Do,\" and enjoyed my bike ride through the park.\n\n#9: Admiration, Don\'t Cry Over Spilled Milk\n\"I\'d ask him to go get the milk but he\'d probably find a way to screw it up,\" I typed smiling. \"Who are you texting?\" he asked. \"My boyfriend,\" I snarked without blinking his direction. He looked at me with a growing resent and exhaled a silent \"fuck you\".\n\n#10: Family Commitment, Stand-Off\n\"We need to talk,\" I said sitting on the couch across from him. \"I\'m not happy and staying for junior isn\'t working.\" I took a long breath, wiping a tear from my cheek, hearing him ask \"What\'s wrong?\" I looked at him with my watery eyes and explained, \"It\'s fine, at times, but it\'s missing something still, even after the counseling and the second chance you gave me,\" I blew my nose and looked at him, \"We love each other for junior, not for us.\" He sighed, realizing she was right, thinking \"isn\'t that why we agreed to stay together after your affair\", and asked, \"Okay, now what then?\" A long silence stood between us until I answered, \"one of us leaves.\"\n\n\"Well,\" the counselor said with a short sigh, \"Scott,\" looking at him, \"Christine,\" turning his head to the left at me, \"when you leave today take some time together and talk about those things.\" He smiled at the room and finished up his helpful advice with, \"remember, communication in any relationship is the glue to happiness.\"\n\nI felt my phone vibrate in my purse and took out, \"How r u?\" I read and texted back, \"I didn\'t have the courage to tell him it\'s over.\" It vibrated a few seconds later, \"that\'s what you said last time.\" My fingers swiped across the keyboard in angst, \"I told you to let me handle it.\" Another shake from the phone, \"he\'s never going to leave,\" it read. I swiped back, \"you don\'t know that.\"\n\nScott watched me and asked a little bit annoyed, \"who are you texting?\"\n\n\"The sitter,\" I lied.\n\nI paid the counselor $50 and we left without change.

The situation of me and Aimee and the affair from I guess two years ago. There is no more affair. There is no more \"us\". I\'m not sure why I hold on, or where I continue to keep something alive that is clearly not anymore.

After you leave your bootcamp sessions and riding, swimming, running, and you get home and help Seth with his homework and put him to sleep do you feel like there is something missing? I stopped in front of your house at 2:15 AM last night. It looked like the front door was open.

From the one hour (maybe it was two - in all honesty I got sucked into Words With Friends) Q&A I took away a single comment made by Coyier relating to CodePen\'s CSS that in one weekend, two months later, changed my CSS life forever.\n\nNow before the 2014 CSS Dev Conference I had experimented with SASS (using the SCSS syntax) and much like during a blind date I thought it was a pretty and elegant way to handle css. It was creative, smart and with just enough sass and could easily hold an intelligent conversation with my HTML, but once I came down from cloud nine, the ability to create variables and nested styles really wasn\'t worth the investment of effort for me and wasn\'t something I wanted to pursue a long-term relationship with; although, there was that one blonde. Anyhow, the deal breaker for me was how SASS (SCSS) presented the compiled CSS, in specific, media-queries. In a big huff and puff about it at work one day I snubbed my nose and never looked back and returned to coding long-hand using some great shorthand tools like Emmet in Sublime Text. However as my CSS grew more tentacles with media queries and the files themselves were abstracted for a higher level organization I was starting to realize that this too wasn\'t working and perhaps it was me and not SASS (SCSS). Be smarter than I was and understand you will never have to edit the minimized CSS file generated by your preprocessor (such as CodeKit or Koala) so who the frak cares what it looks like, right? Just say yes.\n\nSo, once I accepted that it was me, not SASS (SCSS), I typed in Firefox\'s awesome bar: \"Coyier CodePen CSS\" and finally read his mind-blowing blog post about how CodePen leverages SCSS. Now, similar to CodePen I separate my CSS into numerous smaller SCSS files that are easy to manage, semantically readable code, use Autoprefixer (although I apply browser specific prefixes through Sublime Text) and then through CodeKit I build a single minimized CSS file built from one \"table contents\" SCSS file. Pure brilliance Chris!\n\nIt\'s definitely worth a \"pedi-cab!\" ride over to Coyier\'s blog post for some great tips on better organizing your CSS life with SCSS, or more commonly referred to as SASS.','',429,'2014-12-21 22:26:53','2015-01-21 23:37:01',0,0,0),

	(112,36,1,1,'Jaybird Reign, First 48 Hours','Surprisingly the tipping point in my choice to throw on the sweats and drive to Best Buy and return my Garmin Vivosmart and pay a little over $200 for this sexy-silicone-band-with-a-brain and oscillating cylon eye was a video that I watched on Twitter @jaybirdsport. It wasn\'t about the Regin at all (or the petite cute blonde in the video), but how the company was out having fun with the Ice Bucket Challenge. After a few more minutes swiping through their timeline I realized this company, from the CEO, Judd Armstrong, to the employees dumping buckets of ice water on their heads have a real passion for helping people attain their goals, as well as for their flagship earbuds which they proudly propped. So far, in the first 48 hours, I haven\'t been wrong: Jaybird is all about \"Power Your Passion\", but can the Reign live up to Jaybird\'s mantra? Lets jump on in and explore.\n\nWhat makes the Jaybird Sport Reign different from every other activity tracker on the crowded shelves of similar product is that it Reign focuses on aligning your body with your physical activities and uses the biometric data collected from the band to help you attain the level of fitness you strive. It\'s not just something you wear around your wrist to count how many steps you have taken and calories burned. As I prepare myself for a Triathlon Sprint I chose the Reign to be my inner-fitness voice. This is perfect, because the Reign wants you to forget you\'re wearing it. It wants to become part of you from the minute you wake up until the moment you fall asleep and then guide you into a healthy tomorrow, challenging your fitness activity and as keep you in as they say, \"the Go-Zone\".\n\nThe first 48 hours with the Reign have been a little off balance. Part of it is me understanding how the Reign\'s philosophy works and breaking my previous \"step tracking\" thought-behavior which is to judge my progress on a count step and calorie burn. Nutrition is a piece of the puzzle Jaybird has yet to even put on the table, so you\'re best options are MyfitnessPal or Livestrong\'s MyPlate (my preference app right now for this data type). The Reign science learns your activities, sleep patterns and monitors your Heart Rate Variability (HRV) http://bit.ly/1D7BW3o so that you know it\'s a great time to challenge yourself or a good day to rest up. Do you ever feel like you\'re getting sick or stressed over a deadline at work? Believe it or not this shows up in your HRV and the Reign uses this data to your fitness advantage. Now, if it just would all work as well as it\'s packaged and advertised, I\'d ride my bike all the way to Utah and kiss that petite blonde in the Ice Bucket Challenge. But Jaybird has some work ahead of itself, but it\'s oh so close.\n\nThe packaging is magniflorious. I haven\'t seen a piece of tech packaged so beautifully since the first iPhone. The cover unfolds, revealing a stunning, master-crafted fitness band that is \"soft and seamless with sand-blasted chrome clips\". It is everything, if not more in-person than how the promotional video http://vimeo.com/107179946 describes. Under the space gray foam the band sits inside are all the wonderful accessories, including the charger, two extra silicone straps with clips for sizing, an ankle strap for cycling and two silicone bands without the clips for swimming. Also included is a small tool for cleaning the clips. What would have made the packaging better are small graphical icons indicating each item would be used. For example, a small gray icon of a swimmer under the bands without clasps and maybe a small illustration of the tool and clip to imply cleaning. A minor touch that would have saved me a trip to the online FAQ.\n\nIMG_0561\n\n \n\nFitting was a snap. Although I was concerned at first because the sizing graph on the back of the box indicated that a small was appropriate for me, where as, other activity trackers I have used (Fitbit Flex & Charge and Garmin Viviosmart) I sized to a large. Jaybird\'s chart was correct and all Reign bands in the small package fit comfortably. I use the tighter one when I worked out this morning because it fits snugger higher up my arm freeing up wrist joint and found the slightly bigger one more comfortable while around the office (or Starbucks in this case) since it fits a touch more loose like a watch.\n\nIMG_0534\n\nCharging took longer than expected; almost 3 hours and at first didn\'t work. Tech excites me and the Reign was unboxed before I left the Best Buy parking lot. The small charge clip was easy to figure out and snap onto the pod. I plugged the micro USB cable into it the charging clip and the other USB end into my car; simple. I expected some lights to blink to indicate charging, but nothing happened (and yes, I turned on my car to give the USB port power). I jiggled the cable and a red light began to blink. When I got home and moved the charger indoors I had the same problem. The same jiggle fixed it. I am expecting that the soft, flexible USB cable has an internal issue and will eventually need replacing. After about 3 hours it was completely lit up red with one green light; I assumed it was charged, although I would have expected all the lights to be green not just one. This confused me a touch but my tech instinct said it was good to go.\n\nNow this is when the Regin started tripping me up. I popped the pod into the band. It snapped in magnetically, but honestly the magnets are not as strong as the video on Jaybird\'s website make them sound. Purely by accident, I dropped it from about 6 inches onto the carpet and that was enough to make the pod pop out. Later that night I took off my jacket from a cold evening walk and the band flew out the sleeve, again, the pod landing on the carpet a few feet away. I suppose while adjusting my sleeve and gloves I inadvertently unclasped the band without feeling it. I expected the magnetic clasp to be much much stronger than it actually appears in the promotional video. The click sound is cool though; reminds me of the magnetic power-clip on my Macbook Air, which is designed for a quick, non-destructive release. So, despite the style is cool on the Reign it may not be a practical solution for a $200 wearable device that you really don\'t want to quickly release.\n\n \n\n \nPairing the Reign pod with my iPhone 6 was just as clumsy. I followed the directions displayed in the app, lightly wet the top and bottom of the pod and sat for a few minutes (they state it could take longer than 20 seconds) with the band on my wrist and finger on the cylon eye (lighted strip) to no success. Eventually I checked the online FAQ and removed the pod from the band and tried again. Still no pairing success. A bit frustrated, and reaching the 10 minute point of a simple Bluetooth pairing, I licked the pod and squeezed it with my thumb and index finger firmly and bam! 5 seconds later it was paired. When I verified my pairing through the iOS 8 settings I noticed something interesting. My other BT devices: my car and FitBit Charge all had a blue circle \"i\" icon that would allow me to \"forget\" the device but the \"Regin\" did not. Additionally, the Reign would not synch if another Bluetooth device was also connected. Finally paired, and my last task of the night, I went to bed with great anticipation to see how well the Reign auto-detected my sleep and to try the Go-Zone for the first time in the morning --goodnight moon.\n\nSeven hours later, the morning sun peeked between blinds waking me up. I took my phone off the nightstand and tapped the Reign app to see what my sleep was like but to my disappointment the phone and pod wouldn\'t sync and no sleep was showing on the app\'s Sleep page. After restarting the app a few times still no success, I restarted my phone. Eventually the Reign app indicated \"Band Found\" and synched, but unfortunately having to quit the app several times. Once the app was done \"synchronizing\" and the \"Processing\" to my next disappointment no sleep was tracked. I flipped it to the \"Go-Zone\" page where it said \"Try again tomorrow upon waking\" and that I did; only to awake to the same message the next morning.\n\n \n\n\n\n \nThroughout both day\'s the Regin successfully tracked and labeled my mile walk around Huffaker Hill in Reno, as well did a good job at knowing when I was inactive (or driving or sitting in Starbucks writing this for the past 2 hours). Then, the following morning it tagged my 7-Minute workout as a \"general activity\" correctly without me having to tell it what type of activity I did. I don\'t expect it to be smart enough to know the difference between Crossfit or Yoga workouts, but the fact it didn\'t type it as a walk, run, ride or swim was great! Later in the day I went for a short 7 mile bike ride and used the included ankle strap for cycling but categorized it as \"sports\" and not \"cycling\". \n\nJust imagine the possibilities if Jaybird considers partnering with some other fitness focused apps like MapMyFitness, Active.Com, RunKeeper or Livestrong\'s MyPlate and integrate a social user base with challenges software based coaching for 5/10ks, marathons, triathlons and more. As of now, the Reign is stuck in the yellow-zone; use with the understanding it has some of rough edges to smooth out.\n\nClearly there are problems, but thank fully most can be addressed with software updates. The current Reign app for iOS is buggy only in the sense in that it won\'t synch properly when you want it to. Eventually there is a data burst and it magically appears accurate. My tech-gut tells me that there is probably an issue with their Bluetooth stack and the pod\'s firmware to communicate with the iPhone. However, at this price point, problems like this should been ironed out before it reached the consumer\'s wrist.\n\nI have contacted Jaybird support via twitter and they promptly -I mean within hours fast- replied asking me to contact their technical support.  After Jaybird has a chance to address my problems I will continue this review. We will see what they can do. Hopefully in the next few weeks and after several app updates, the Reign will be a game changer in the fitness world and help me accomplish my goal of a Sprint Triathlon or riding my bike to Utah ;-)\n\nKeep an eye on my Twitter @sjamesmccarthy for an update to this review deeper look at the Jaybird\'s Reign app.\n\nPros: Great design with unique, new approach at fitness activity trackers!\nCons: Software and pod firmware appear to be a bit buggy.\nUrl: http://www.jaybirdsport.com/reign-activity-tracker/','',1872,'2015-01-04 14:18:56','2015-01-21 23:36:15',0,0,0),

	(110,36,1,1,'2015, The Year of the Wearable','Happy New Year! and welcome to the next year of technology: wearables and connected devices. During the last half of 2014 I\'m sure you read many, many blog postings, tweets and news posts regarding wearable technology and connected devices.\n\nIf you were at CES 2014 last year then you were one of the lucky people to see some of upcoming wearable technology hands-on. Everything from Samsung\'s Gear, Apple\'s Watch, Google Glass, FitBit\'s new Charge devices to Microsoft\'s shocking entry into fitness tech. It\'s a whirl-wind of step counting, calorie tracking, sleep analysis, wireless, turn-your-thermostat-on-and-coffee-maker-off-all-from-desk-chair-at-work-world that is starting to get competitive.<!--more-->\n\nOver the past four months I have gotten my feet wet in this wearable, connected-device world through activity or fitness tracking devices. First with a FitBit Flex, then a Misfit Flash, FitBit Charge and most recently Garmin\'s Vivosmart. It\'s an affordable way, $99 to $180, to introduce yourself and play in a new market, a new tech-trend that isn\'t on the higher-end price range of more sophisticated wearables like Samsung\'s Gear Neo, Apple\'s Watch, Moto 360 or Pebble.\n\nWhether it\'s activity tracking, turning on and off lights from another city or extending the features of your current smartphone, the first question you should ask yourself is: What is my goal? This is going to help you decide what kind of wearable or connected device will work best.\n\nIf your goal is wanting to turn up the heat in the house on a colder than usual day or not have to worry about unlocking your front door with your hands full of grocery bags, then you will be searching for a connected device versus a wearable. <a href=\"https://nest.com\">Nest</a> or <a href=\"http://www.insteon.com\">Insteon</a> offer some great Wi-Fi thermostats and <a href=\"https://lockitron.com\">Lockitron</a> or <a href=\"http://danalock.com\">Danalock</a> have some easy ways to convert your existing deadbolt into a wireless lock using Bluetooth. So as long as you have your phone, you will have a way to unlock your front door, as well as turn up the heat or cool down AC on a hot day. There are also Wi-fi enabled light bulbs and electrical switches becoming available. Imagine having the control to turn on your family room TV in Sacramento, California from Paris, France. Why? Why not.\n\nHowever, maybe your goal is that you want to use tech to help you become more active? or maybe shed a few of those holiday pounds? A basic activity tracking wearable device, like Fitbit\'s Flex, Jawbone\'s Up24 or Garmin\'s Vivofit will track steps and report calorie burn, providing you with daily/weekly/monthly graphs and charts helping you to attain your goal. Fitbit takes it a step further providing a food diary within its mobile app. Each device has it\'s own unique strategy (or \"science\" in Fitbit\'s case) so take the time to read the reviews on Amazon as well as download the device\'s software and look at it. Do your research, because even though activity trackers all basically do the same thing -step counters- there are major feature differences and gaps in mobile software, which you may or may not want or discover the perfect device -band wise- but the software is lacking. This I feel is the case for the sexy and expensive <a href=\"http://www.jaybirdsport.com/reign-activity-tracker/\">Jaybird Reign.</a> Incredibly well made and designed band, but trips itself up in half-baked software, making it really hard to invest $200 on an activity tracker that can\'t show you any stats from the previous day or have a web based interface or online community. But, it does have some unique features like Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and focuses less on calorie intake and burn and more on just being active and using its machine intelligence (data the device collects) to help you be better at the fitness you love to do and predicting the days you will be best at it.\n\nNow, if you want apps, a calendar, send/receive calls and texts then you have just leveled-up your requirements and may consider a smart-watch. Although some fitness bands like Microsoft\'s fitband, Fitbit\'s upcoming Surge and Garmin\'s Vivosmart also provide \"smart-notifications\", or they display alerts for calls, texts and notifications usually on a small OLED display; however, this accomplished with limitations and that\'s where the smart-watch adds functionality.\n\nMost of these smart-watch devices will allow you answer a call from your wrist, as well as send a text using your voice. They also count steps, stairs and distances like activity trackers, appealing to a high-level of health goals but at the end of the day of trying to be that all-in-one wearable that does everything; okay. This may not be your cup of tea, and ultimately end up disappointing you because most smart-watches are still tightly coupled with having their master (the phone) nearby in order to reasonably work as advertised, which in my opinion almost defeats their purpose. If I am spending $349 on an Apple Watch it needs to have the following tech in: activity tracker functions, GPS, offline music playback, touch screen, waterproof (not resistant), somewhat ruggedized, but work without requiring that my phone has to be 50 feet from the watch.\n\nThere is one problem that all wearables whether smart-watches or activity trackers share is the lack of adequate or expandable device memory for offline features like playing music, voicemail and data storage that keeps our phone tethered to us in circumstances, like running, swimming, biking, or just a big house, where the purpose of having a wearable device is to simplify your tech for the task at hand.\n\nSo what\'s the answer? Use the tool that does the job and does it well. Would you use a screw driver to drive a nail into a piece of wood? I think you understand what I am getting to and can use other similar analogies to make a great decision on what kind of wearable or connected device that will best fit your needs and your lifestyle.','',985,'2015-01-01 13:18:50','2015-01-21 23:36:14',0,0,0),

Some want it like Dr. Dre,  tweaking the music to emphasize the bass and vocals, while depressing the \"less interesting\" middle frequencies, thus giving it a sharpness to your ear. Others may want their music a little more flat sounding or prefer it be like a \"CD\" and finally you have the \"the way it was recorded at the studio\" crowd. Defining each of those presets is a little subjective in my opinion and going to be a picky crowd to please. So how do all these online music services like Beats, Spotify and Tidal make everyone happy? With their library selection, price, app interfaces and sound quality.\n\nMy first impression with Beats was \"wow, these tunes are crisp, clear and sharp\" compared to Spotify and so I switched services for 30 days wooed over by Beats sound quality. I was curious on why Beats sounded so much better to me. Both Beats and Spotify stream different qualities of the song based on network type, delivery method (mobile app vs. web app) and membership status.  Beats FAQ http://bit.ly/1y0x5Oq reads, \"On the web, we stream in 320kbps MP3 quality audio - industry standard high quality audio for streaming services.  A small minority of tracks may not be available for 320, in which case we\'ll stream in 256kbps.\"  Spotify\'s FAQ http://bit.ly/1ID2ec8 reads, \"We use 3 quality ratings all in Oog Vorbis format. ~96 kbps for normal quality on mobile; ~160 kbps for desktop and web player standard quality. High quality on mobile is ~320 kbps (only available to Premium subscribers) and is considered high quality on desktop and extreme quality on mobile.\" \n\nThat wasn\'t much of a technical difference but the auditory improvements are quite noticeable. Then at Starbucks one day I was becoming frustrated with Spotify\'s flat sound once again, and it hit me: EQ settings. Spotify has no option to adjust the EQ on their desktop clients, either OS X or Windows. Although, this feature was recently added to their iOS mobile app (not sure about Android).  I googled Beats EQ and bam! I found my answer. Beats automatically applies Dr. Dre\'s EQ settings on the tracks streamed, thus giving them, in my opinion, a superior sound quality. \n\nSo how do I make Spotify sound more like Beats? Or just less flat. Adjust your EQ. On my Macbook Air I simply installed http://goo.gl/iVsYp Soundflower and Apple\'s free Audio Lab app (Windows users will need to google a different solution) then made a few tweaks and now I have better sounding tunes through Spotify. Not exactly the same sound as Beats by Dr. Dre, but much richer in tone with the adjusted settings. \n\n__img__\n\nRemember the quality capabilities of the device you are outputting to have auditory ranges and limitations. Although one EQ settings my be great on your Bose home system they may not work so great on your Skullcandy headphones. I don\'t have a deep technical understanding of all the frequency ranges and just moved the sliders up and down until something sounded great! sounded similar to Beats by Dr. Dre.\n\nJim, why not just save yourself some time and use Beats in the first place? I tried it for 45 days and found the curated playlists to be out of date. During the 2014 holidays, Beats was suggesting playlists titled \"Christmas 2012\" and \"Best songs of 2011\". In addition, Beats has no radio style feature relying entirely on its community to create relevant playlists of relevant music.\n\nSpotify on the other hand has radio based on genre or similar to Pandora you can create your own station. In addition, Spotify also has curated playlists and a rather unexplored area of Spotify include apps which give you an interesting interaction with services like last.fm and pitchfork that add value to my music listening experience in a similar way that I listen to music.\n\nYou have probably noticed that most of these services are price driven, with Spotify clearly being the winner in my opinion for family at $9.99 a month +$5 a month additional family members, then recently with Beats lowering it\'s price to $9.99 month or $99 a year (that\'s basically getting 2 months free) and finally Tidal which brands itself as offering \"high fidelity music\" at a whopping cost of $20 a month. Even with my incredible Jaybird BlueBud X earbuds I don\'t think I could hear a $10 month difference while running or cycling or sitting in Starbucks, but I also haven\'t tried the service out yet; a free 7-day trial requiring my credit card tastes sour to me.\n\nOn a last note, choose the music service that fits your listening style. If you like to listen to CDs top to bottom and build playlists as well a library than Beats may be a good choice for you, but if you like to discover new music and only have a few playlists of your own Spotify may be the way to listen.

	(115,36,1,1,'10 Days With My Jaybird Reign Activity Tracker','When I walked out of Best Buy after purchasing the Jaybird Reign I had big expectations for this sleek looking silicone band; available in black and white. Wooed by its design and fresh thinking for activity trackers, which is to give meaning to your steps, activity and heart information above just showing a metric on a pretty graph, I was ready to join this team and go beyond counting my steps and calories burned.  I was pumped to run, swim and bike!\n\nJaybird raced into the fitness world with their  remarkable sounding and highly acclaimed http://bit.ly/1y99BFA Bluebuds X Bluetooth Headphones and the new family member, Reign,  has the same great showmanship qualities and thought-though innovative design. During my 10 day evaluation I tested whether the Reign lives up to creator\'s vision http://bit.ly/1u2doGb and mantra of \"knowing when your body wants to be active\". \n\nFrom the start, the Reign received Best of Show awards from http://bit.ly/1xvb7CT Engadget, Slashgear and Outdoor Retailer. It clearly earns these accolades for its smooth silicone band that is sexy, durable, waterproof -not just resistant- and most comfortable to wear design that is functional as well as fashionable. \n\nLike me, you are probably sold too, especially after watching the videos on the Reign website, but in a tight race of other activity trackers where price point is crucial,  the Reign has to smoke the competition at $199 MSRP ($217 total with tax for me, which is a lot of money for an activity tracker but comparable -on the high side- in it\'s category which includes heart monitoring and usually some small notification features).\n\nAccording to Founder & CEO Judd Armstrong and CMO Rene Oehlerking the Reign has four problems to solve. The Reign\'s solutions to these four problems make it different from it\'s competition and in many ways better. But like any newly innovated product or idea, it comes with some hiccups and hurdles.\n\nThe first challenge was to eliminate the bulk of the band. Never once did I feel like I was wearing an activity band or device and when positioned just above the wrist joint using a band that fit snug the Reign virtually disappeared, practically becoming an invisible extension of my arm. This made activities from push-ups, burpees and even a simple plank position to writing on a laptop for several hours at a time easy to do and comfortable.  This was a quick win for the Reign over other activity trackers like the Fitbit Flex, Garmin Vivosmart or even Jawbone\'s UP24. It\'s simply the most comfortable activity tracker I have worn. I never thought about taking it off and honestly didn\'t want to. I loved how it felt both physically on my wrist and how it made me feel mentally; visual encouragement.\n\nThe second goal was to create an understanding your daily activity and the meaningful, actionable guidance that you really care about. It\'s not a tracker designed to simply count steps, activities and burned calories. This is done through the Reign\'s mobile app. Currently, as of time of this review, the app is only available for Apple iOS users. Android version will be released January 2015, but as of the 15th it\'s still not appearing in the Google Play Marketplace. The iOS app for the most part delivered on this goal on, but only a high level, without consistency and it\'s important to know that your data is currently, as of version 1.3.3, is only stored on your phone and if for some reason you re-pair or logout of your Reign account the data will erased.\n\nThe first major missing part of the current app is a history. You can only view information for the current day. This means that you have no way of looking back and seeing how you slept the day before or yesterday\'s Go-Zone score or even look at this data over any period of time for comparison which could be valuable in analyzing trends. There is also no web-based site you log into for deeper metrics nor is your data currently sent to Jaybird. \n\nNot to worry though, according to update schedule on Jaybird\'s website for the Reign these fixes are underway and planned for this coming January and February 2015. In fact there is some pretty cool features underway like backup to the Regin Cloud, notifications and alerts and access to you activity history. Something Jaybird might consider is a more aggressive update schedule, perhaps every 2 weeks, to attack some of the low-hanging and crucial bugs as well provide an early look at upcoming features and maybe add iCloud support. That small enhancement would have saved my random data loss problem.\n\n(link to first 48 hours review) After unboxing the Reign, I charged up the device for about 3 hours, which was about an hour longer than the directions read. Once fully charged the Reign pod was ready to pair with my iPhone 6. With the Reign on snug on my wrist, I pressed my index finger on top of the band (where the LEDs display) and tapped the pair button in the app. The app displayed that this could take up to 20 seconds. I was patient and probably waited about a minute until eventually it failed. I tried again, this time lightly wetting the contact points as suggested and waited. Again it failed. Out of frustration because pairing a device should not be this difficult, I popped the pod out of the band and licked both sides of it, ensuring it was wet as suggested, and held it between my thumb (bottom side) and index finger. Bam! in less than 5 seconds it paired and I was ready to start moving.\n\nEager to test out the Reign\'s ability to auto-detect different activity types the next day I tried a range of activities. Starting out with a http://bit.ly/1DDUGHY 7-Minute Workout. The Reign successfully logged it as \"Sports\" but for only 2 minutes when it was realistically about 10 minutes. Next up was a short run down the American River and again Reign nailed it. It was a little off on the duration, but it detected the activity correctly. Later in the evening I removed the pod from the wrist band and popped it into the ankle band for a bike ride. The ride was 9.91 miles, about 45 minutes of constant peddling. Unfortunately the Reign failed to recognize this activity type as \"cycling\". In fact the majority of my day resulted in \"general\" activity. It did a good on detecting walking and when I compared the Reign\'s step count to the step count my iPhone 6 reported the two were always within a reasonable to range to each other. I did not test swimming; the lake is too cold right now, but am excited to try it in the spring and maybe with a new Reign with a more robust app.\n\nSo how does this translate into meaningful, actionable guidance? Right now it seems like any other activity tracker, but the Reign goes a next step and each activity gets a \"variable activity score\".  I asked their support what that means and really didn\'t get a clear answer. Although support was extremely responsive as well as interested in my challenges with the device and software. So, from what I surmise is that it is an activity based algorithm that combines exertion and activity into a point system that is used to help set your goals and over time help determine how hard you can push yourself or what activity type you can do to accomplish your daily goal. The goal itself is emphasized with a point value and then suggested activities that would meet that point value. This is okay I suppose but confusing. Why have the points displayed at all? For example, I can ear my 1,609 points with 37 minutes of walking or 16 minutes of running or 22 minutes of cycling. The activity durations make sense to me, the points might as well be something the app just computes without me knowing because it seems like ambiguous data that I don\'t need to know in order to understand and accomplish my daily activity. Metrics are fun to look at though, I guess.\n\nThe third goal is sleep, and according to CMO Rene Oehlerking, \"simply tracking sleep is weak, but how much sleep do you personally need tonight to be at your best tomorrow \". When I heard this I liked the idea and was excited to see how the Reign app presented my sleep and used the metric to determine a better tomorrow. However, my first few nights with the Reign sleep tracking were inconsistent and the automatic sleep detection didn\'t work. In fact, several nights were not tracked and I had to manually enter the hour when I to bed and the hour I woke up. Unfortunately I think this misses all the in-between moments of restless sleep, deep sleep, moments of being awake, etc, so how does the Reign know how much sleep I need tonight if it can\'t consistently track it automatically. And, no where in the app I could find suggestions on when to go to bed based on previous sleep/wake times. In the few days it did successfully track my sleep, the recommendation read, \"You are getting great sleep lately and have been exceeding your ideal nightly sleep duration. Keep it up!\" Amazing, but determined mostly on my manually entries. I think there is great potential in this feature but the Reign certainly fell short in comparison other trackers that automatically track sleep like the Fitbit Charge or Garmin\'s Vivosmart. It also does not have silent, vibrating alarms, which once you start using you will never go back to waking to beeps or radio again.\n\nThe fourth goal is knowing when your body wants to be active or when you need to take a day to recover. This is what Jaybird calls the \"Go-Zone\" and where all this activity recognition and sleep tracking work together, plus one other piece of data that as far as I know other activity trackers don\'t use, which is http://bit.ly/1syWrCn Heart Rate Variability (HRV), or the milliseconds between your heartbeats that can indicate fatigue, stress or in the Reign\'s case, over training.\n\nWhen you wake in the morning, what\'s suppose to happen is your Reign pod (firmware version 3.5.2) syncs with the Regin app of the first time. Unfortunately, in my experience the Reign pod and phone synchronize successfully on the first attempt about 40% of the time. I consistently had to force close the app 3 or 4 times in order to synchronize. Additionally other connected Bluetooth devices would sometimes prevent the pod from synching. This included Jaybird\'s BlueBuds X headphones in my testing, as well my Subaru\'s bluetooth system. \n\nOnce the Reign pod synchronizes your nightly data, which must include sleep whether automatically tracked or manually inputed, the Go-Zone will measure your HRV by resting your finger on the LED band for 2 minutes. When the countdown timer gets to zero your Go-Zone number will appear. If you\'re in the range of 40-60 then your body is ready to be active regardless of what you may \"think\". In the two times that the GO-Zone worked for me it was right on the money. Although I didn\'t \"feel\" like running one day or cycling the next, my Go-Zone was 45 the first day and 65 the second and both days I trusted my Go-Zone reading and just did it and wow, what a great workout I had on both occasions that without the Go-Zone push I probably would have ended up being less active.\n\nDespite all the tripping the Reign and I did through our 10 days of being active together, I would like to try this product again once the software has had a few updates and the synchronization process is more stable. The direction Jaybird is moving with the Regin is unlike any other activity tracker in how it analyzes activity metrics to help you achieve the most activity out of your day, even when you don\'t think you can. \n\nI really like this product and found the majority of my problems with the software. The band is five-star awesome! I will definitely be coming back to the Reign family once I see the reviews on the app store and at Amazon start rising up to where they should be, but Jaybird will not get there anytime soon without healing their app\'s injuries and getting it on more frequent update schedule to earn back consumer\'s trust.','',2098,'2015-01-13 11:57:26','2015-01-22 19:40:52',0,1,0),

So I walked up to the counter, a mosaic of broken ceramic tile creating a pinkish, blue and yellow sunset setting behind whitecap mountains and I asked the barista for another bag of Earl Grey.  She looked at me with a small smile apologizing that they were unfortunately out of tea.\n\n\"How can a coffee and tea shop be out of tea?\" I chuckled, \"Well, it\'s not that we are out of all tea,\"  she explained with her cute, persuasive smile, \"we still have Green Tea and White Tea with Pomegranate that I promise are just as good.\" I smiled back at her thinking that *I have been coming here every Tuesday for the last five years and they have never been out of black tea.*  And, while I pondered the meaning of it, she offered to check in the back. Is it a sign that maybe it is time to try something knew or just stop trying to over analyze the situation I thought. They say that the hardest part of change is taking the first step. \n\n\"I\'m sorry James,\" she was saying when my phone vibrated inside my sweatshirt pocket. I peeked at the screen with hesitation and flipped the screen over, reading the message and hearing her voice faintly in the background finish saying that she couldn\'t find any more.\n\n<span style=\"margin-left: 40px\">*I can\'t be be who you want me to be, but I will always love you*</span>  --the text read. \n\n*Did I just say that out loud.* By the look the on her face I would say I did. Quickly I disguised my disappointment and pain mumbling about how green tea isn\'t the same but I would I try a cup; the one with pomegranate. And, then walked to my table on the front patio outside where I sat swirling the remaining, cold, black tea.\n\nShe watched me gulp down the last of the drops and whispered to herself,  \"I know you will,\" hanging up her apron for the day and walking the cup of tea outside to me on her way home.\n \n\"What are you reading?\" she asked sitting across the table, running her hand through her straight, blonde hair that hung just below her shoulders with a solemn expression; twisting the end with her fingers.\n\n\"This month\'s issue of [__8149__](http://eightyonefortynine.com/),\" I answered watching her wrap her hands around the warm cup. \"It\'s a magazine for the hopeless romantic\" I said, \"I have a short essay about forbidden love published in this issue.\" \n\nShe looked me with the blue twinkle of her eyes through her Michael Kors frames along with a flirty, alluring smile and said, \"Look into my eyes and tell me what you see?\" I noticed she put on a light pink lipstick before coming outside to the patio after her shift ended.

A light breeze passed by us picking up her sweet perfume and carrying it to my nose. \n\n\"I see a married woman.\"\n\nShe slid off her platinum and blue sapphire wedding band and looked at me again, this time with a connecting stare that reached inside me, cradling my heart, while her foot traced up the outside of my leg under the table, \"try again,\" she softly spoke, reaching across the table, our hands tangled.\n\nAt that moment of being lost in everything around us, we felt found as the moment lingered in our eyes.\n\n','aimee fiction essay ',583,'2015-01-19 12:02:01','2015-02-10 12:07:02',0,1,0),

	(122,36,1,1,'Writing a RESTful API in PHP Part 1','It\'s not everyday you wake up and thinking you\'re going to spend it coding a RESTful API, but it was a cold, rainy day here Sacramento so why I thought why not plug in the [Jaybird BludBuds X](http://bit.ly/1y99BFA) headphone\'s for a battery life test and begin my own personal hackathon.  \n\nLets start with the basics. What is a RESTful API and why would I even want to invest a day or my writing one. REST is an acronym for [Representational State Transfer](http://bit.ly/15zbqlC) (REST) and is a software architecture style consisting of guidelines and best practices for creating scalable web services. An API  is yet another acronym in the programming world standing for: [Application Programming Interface] (http://bit.ly/15zcjL1) [source: wikipedia]. A basic use of a RESTful API would be to share content (or data) between online communities and other programs, typically in the usage of a URI like http://api.[domain].com/v1/user/get/23 which returns the result in either XML or JSON formats.\n\nMy need for an RESTful API is for another one of my web assets, [Page126](http://page126.com). I want to be able to share a piece of content created on Page126 with another one of my web assets [No More Black Tea](http://nomoreblacktea.com). Although they are on the same shared server, I could simply fetch the database row from the other domain and share it internally through the PHP code, but what fun is that? Plus it\'s still raining outside, and a RESTful API would let other users not on the same server be able to share what they write in Page126 as well. \n\nSo, my goal in the first release of this simple RESTful API written in PHP, and titled, [pedicabAPI](http://bit.ly/1CBF4AK) is to create the high-level architecture (or skeleton model) of the API. Functionally, this version of the API will allow only allow for cross-origin connections and include 1 method, the GET verb -for starters because it\'s all I really need right now. [You can download the source at Github if you want.](http://bit.ly/1CBF4AK). Verbs are basically the jargon that the server and browser  use to pass information back and forth. You only really use the word \"verb\" to describe the method, in which case for semantic purposes I also called the actionable variable in the code $verb.\n\nBefore I got to typing a lick of code I chicken scratched some pseudo code determining what my short term and long term needs would be and then decided on a simple but scalable file structure (see image below). The first thing I hope you noticed is how versions of the API have been separated into subdirectories, and each verb associated with the API has it\'s own model. In my head, this just helps visually organize your programming logic. It\'s basically MVC with the View being the API response in either XML or JSON which is returned by the controller, in this case, API.php.\n\nLets take a quick birds-eye-view of the code and then if you\'re like me, you will want to just dive into it and make it your own. This is why I [posted it on Github](http://bit.ly/1CBF4AK) so please fork it if you wish. \n\n__.htaccess__  \nWe start things off with a quick URL rewrite using Apache\'s .htaccess. This lets you use clean URI\'s like http:://[domain]/[version]/[endpoint]/[verb]/[id] without the query string or ? and & symbols you may see on other website URLs. I think the easiest way to explain this is to look at it. \n\n     <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\n     RewriteEngine On\n\n     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !(/$|\\.) \n     RewriteRule (.*) %{REQUEST_URI}/ [R=301,L] \n\n     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\n     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\n     RewriteRule (.*)/(.*)/(.*)/(.*)/$ v1/index.php?version=$1&endpoint=$2&verb=$3&id=$4 [QSA,NC,L]\n     </IfModule>\n\nThe foreign parts of this are probably the (.*)/ which are simply placeholders for segments of the URL which when the placeholders (eg., the $1, $2, $3 and $4) are then substituted in the same order.\n\n__The bootloader__ - index.php   \nAll this file basically does is startup the API by creating the API object and then serving as a simple traffic cop, routing things to the correct models and methods as requested by the API URI. Nothing fancy really.\n\n__The Controller__ - API.php  \nThis is the core of the process and includes methods that will be inherited by the other models, which I will refer to as the endpoints. The controller will segment the API\'s URI, establish the database connection as well as be used to assign response codes and then return the HTTP/1.1 header with result from the endpoint. At which point the program ends. \n\nIn the next version I will add authentication options for things such as a users login/password and most importantly an API key, as well a private API Key for PUT/POST/DELETE methods. This however would have required new code functionality on Page126 and why for the mean time I didn\'t include it. But, if you would like to contribute to this project and help in development just let me know.\n\n__The Models (or endpoints)__ - pages.php, user.php, etc.  \nHere is where most of the magic happens. I organized my models to match my endpoints. This way as the number endpoint options grew the file wouldn\'t be unmanageable. For example, currently the pages.php model only has 1 method (getPageById) for fetching a single row from the database. Maybe in the future I would like to add a comment to a page via a mobile app. I just add another method (addPageComment), or I want to retrieve all comments for a specific page (getPageCommentsApproved). Any method that is added to this endpoint model only interfaces with database tables relating to Pages. It\'s also worth noting that I am currently not preparing my database queries and then executing. So because of that I scrub the ID received from API URL using the mysqli_real_escape_string  function which will at least escape out special characters to help prevent sql injection. The last thing that this endpoint model will do is request the response the code from the API controller (200 for success and maybe 404 Not Found) and then encode the results in JSON.\n\nYou create as many endpoint methods as you need and bootstrap (index.php) will route them dynamically through the correct verb methods. The only thing you may have to watch is if you change the number of parameters in the API URI. This will effect the mod_rewrite rules in the .htaccess file. \n\n__Okay, now I how to use it__  \nYou will need to use an AJAX request with javascript or PHPs file_get_contents function. Then, format the returned JSON result with HTML/CSS.\n\nFor my implementation on nomoreblacktea.com I used the [Parsedown library for PHP](http://bit.ly/1L0Yzc8) by [Emanuil Rusev](http://erusev.com). \n\n     <article id=\"content\">\n     <?php\n      \n          include(\'lib/Parsedown.php\');\n          include(\'lib/ParsedownExtra.php\');\n          $Parsedown = new Parsedown();\n\n          $api_result = file_get_contents(\'http://api.page126.com/v1/page/get/123/\');\n          $bodycontent = json_decode($api_result);\n          echo $Parsedown->text($bodycontent->{\'content\'});\n\n      ?>\n      </article>\n\nThat\'s it! You can see the above live [here](http://nomoreblacktea.com).\n\nWell look at that the sun is finally out for the first in a week!  \nTime to close the laptop and hit the bike trail finally.\n\nHappy API\'ng!','',1144,'2015-01-18 23:09:16','2015-01-26 20:30:55',0,1,0),

Running her fingers along the archway of stone shaping the top of a heart, the aged wood exterior, cracked and warped and dark like the dirt surrounding it. In the middle, framed like a window, was a painting of a tree; tall with blossoming orange flowers. Despite how old everything was, the painting was in pristine condition. The door wasnâ€™t large, maybe 5 feet tall and 3 feet wide but still doesnâ€™t explain how we missed it earlier while making dropping coins in the puddle.

	(132,2,1,1,'Somewhere Only We Knew','###2  \n__\"HOW DID YOU FIND THIS PLACE?\" SHE ASKED LOOKING AROUND THE WOODS. __ \"I bet it\'s beautiful when its not so cold and frozen,\" admiring the details of the cobblestone fountain, looking lost in a world of enchantment, \"in fact,\" she said, \"we could have a picnic under that tree by the creek and bridge.\" Placing her hand on the winter-trapped vine twisting it\'s dead looking tentacles not noticing the large hawk swoop towards us from the treetops and perch itself on the canopy; curious.\n\nThe folklore people pass around in these parts is that the fountain and bridge were built back before the beginning of time by a young couple who were trapped in forbidden love. This is where they would come to be alone and share their heart. I ran my finger across the heart shaped etchings on the cobblestones thinking about their conversations, listening for their laughter, picturing them sitting on a blanket under the oak tree sharing an afternoon. It felt as if I was reading the scratched hearts like braille, each with their own memory.\n\nThe hawk tilted it\'s head, looking down on her, watching her peer deep into the fountain\'s darkness. \"Don\'t fall in,\" I joked. She looked back at me smiling. The hawk tilted it\'s head back towards me, it\'s beady black eyes staring; curious, and I continued sharing my story.  \n\n\"So the story of this place,\" I said trying to recapture her attention, \"was shared with me by two widowed elderly women I met at La Dolce Vita last week.\" I watched her tug on the rope, wondering if she is listening or still lost in her world. \n\n\"Do you think it\'s odd that this is a seat and not a bucket?\" she asked. Yes, it was a little unorthodox I thought, but, \"what\'s more strange is how sturdy it appears after all these years,\" I answered. She gave it a strong yank; it appeared solid. \"I\'d sit on it,\" she said, obviously distracted to answer my own previous question. \"Yeah, why not,\" I went along, \"we may find a bunch of pennies down there.\" She looked across at me, once again interested in my words. \"For their wishes,\" I said looking down with her.\n\n\"They said the story goes like this: There were two lovers who believed they were destined to be together; he always compassionately called her an Angel God himself dropped from Heaven, but they didn\'t find one another until each was married and had children. The townspeople said he was a hopeless romantic, poet, followed his heart to a fault and the woman had beautiful, long hair, strands of gold with a nurturing heart. She was always around town, tending to her chores as a dutiful wife and was often seen at the edge of a large meadow picnicking with her son under a tall oak tree.\"\n\n\"I bet that was the tree,\" She said pointing through the fountain\'s canopy and across the field to an open space where a creek flowed under a small foot bridge. It\'s large trunk held up the towering, twisted branches with chunks of bark shedding themselves from the cold winter. I looked into her excited and happy smile, agreeing with her. \"Tell me more,\" she said connecting with my eyes.\n\n\"The townspeople said that when those two were together an aura of peace and happiness surrounded them and that their smiles would turn winter into summer as they walked by like magic.\" She smiled absorbing the nature and peace surrounding her. The hawk screeched as two black jays with white spots landed on the bridge. \"The say flowers bloomed out of nowhere in the middle of winter and tree\'s start budding. People who believed as they did, thought it was magic because only true love could have this kind miraculous power. The lovers realized that they couldn\'t have this kind of attention shadowing their every step, so they travelled into the woods and this became the place they would meet, secretly away from the town, away from the people that knew about them so they could be who they believed they were meant to be.\"\n\n\"You know,\" She broke in, \"they remind me a little of us,\" she said. \"I wonder if they carved messages to each other on the bridge, like we do?\"\n\nI smiled like she was reading my mind. \"Well, the old ladies\' at the coffee shop said the bridge is where they would leave messages to each other,\"  I chuckled, \"and other times have quiet picnics, speaking intimately without the need for words. Then one afternoon, after six years of meeting secretly the young woman found the courage and strength to want to change her life.  \n\nWhile they laid together under the oak tree she whispered in her lover\'s ear,  \"I\'m ready to change my life. Return here in ten days from tomorrow and we will leave this place and finally be together.\"\n\nHe returned to the bridge ten days later ready to run away and begin a new life with her. And he waited, and waited. The sun cut through the same winter-sleeping limbs above us and still he waited and waited until the sun fell behind the hill but she never came and he never knew why.\nThey say his tears still puddle at the bottom of the fountain and his lost soul still visits the bridge, etching love notes to her, hoping she will return to find him.\"\n\n\"Lets go down and look,\" she said. \n\"Look for what?\" \n\"His tears.\"\n\nI looked at her mesmerized by the same fairytale and didn\'t think a second time about whether that rope and splintered swing would hold us because it didn\'t seem to matter. The only thing that I mattered was right here in front of me: beautiful, smooth, warm, soft golden strands of hair with a faint luminescence the brightened the grayness of the descending day. I didn\'t care if we ever left the damp murkiness of this fountain\'s dirt floor as long as we were together. \n\n\"Come on,\" she said, \"get on\".\n\nAnd we slowly lowered the seat to bottom.  \nI watched her look at it. Running her fingers along the archway of stone shaping the top of a heart, the aged wood exterior, cracked and warped and dark like the dirt leading up to it. In the middle, framed like a window, was a painting of a tree; tall with blossoming orange flowers. Despite how old everything was, the painting was in pristine condition. The door wasn\'t large, maybe 5 feet tall.\n\nShe knocked.   \n\"I guess no one\'s home,\" teasing me with a smile.\n\"Look, It\'s another heart,\" she said quietly, \"They really liked hearts I guess.\" \n\n\"Why are we whispering,\" I asked, holding the heart shaped lock in the palm of my hand. \n\"I don\'t know,\" she said, \"I don\'t wake the spirits,\" chuckling, \"don\'t step in his tears,\" pointing to the puddle of water I was standing in. Then raised my chin with her cold finger to her  warm lips, outlined with a light pink gloss, and kissed me three times whispering \"I - love - you,\" between each kiss and placing her hand on my chest, \"just you,\" slipping the skeleton key from around my neck which I found under the bridge earlier in the day, and slipped it into the lock\'s heart. \n\nA short click echoed against the fountain\'s circular wall and the latch fell open. They say everything happens for a reason. That people and the world around us are all connected, synchronized to live in harmony, destiny or whatever it is you believe, and our arriving at this place in this time is exactly where we are supposed to be I thought. \n\n\"Open it,\" I said touching her hand, \"it\'s time to go home.\" The wedding ring on her finger vanished in a poof of purple smoke. A ray of light cast against the ground as she pulled the door open, as a loud sucking wind chased us from behind. The Hawk screeched and flew into the sky above with a shrill cry.\n\nHolding hands we ducked our heads under the curved archway and walked into what very well could be our destiny or our greatest mistake.\n\n###3  \n__\"SO WHAT DID THEY WALK INTO,\" SHE ASKED, TAKING A SIP OF HER TEA.__  I looked into her blue eyes that were not willing to take no for an answer.\n\n\"A glimpse of their future.\"','talesoffireflylantern',1415,'2015-01-23 17:34:42','2015-02-09 10:31:17',0,1,0),

Her lips were warm and soft like her cheeks I held between my hands. \n\nâ€œThis time,â€ I said between another kiss, looking into the blue mystery of her eyes lost in an ocean of dreams, I lovingly whispered, â€œletâ€™s try something different.â€ She smiled, pushing her hair away from her face as the Nevada wind swirled around us, Mount Rose blurred in the background. â€œWe will,â€ kissing me back she said, rolling her hands around the back of my head, through my hair.\nI knew what she meant, I thought. I have heard it before so many times that I didnâ€™t know what to believe any longer. In fact, it was at this exact same spot on this Hill that she wrote in a letter three years earlier. I thought about her declaration of love and feelings for me. The raw vulnerability of her words held close to my heart until the day she lied about everything she had written in those pages. Those words crumpled into a meaningless excuse. It was just a fling she told her husband and everyone her image meant something to.  She excused her passionate words justifying they were crafted by the emotional loss of her child and did not mean what they said. I care for you but I donâ€™t love you she later wrote because people were now watching. \n\nIt was different this time though. Today, there was no fear of consequence or talks about being controlled, or guilted into trying to make her marriage work. She was in a better place this time. I could feel the peace she had finally found in her difficult decision after so many years of struggle, depression and dominance over her life. Her eyes had a courage that I remember the first time looking into them that cool day in Colorado. \n\nHer hands slid down my side, a tender kiss . â€œI and want to leave him.â€\n\nOur connection no longer had to reach through dreams or decipher cryptic messages or hide in the shadows of our disposible emotions anymore. We stood on top the Hill this time unconstrained by the complexities of our fears -free to love at last and scream it from the mountain top if we wanted to or whisper it into each otherâ€™s ear in bed without guilt. This time she meant it.\n\nâ€œLook,â€ she said, pointing to a red-tail hawk circling above our heads, playing in the wind, â€œitâ€™s like everything is right where itâ€™s suppose to be finally,â€ watching the bird glide in circles then swoop down landing on a rock below. â€œIt only took us five years,â€ she said with a small love-me smile. I could see my old smiling face in reflecting in the dilated pupils of eyes from five years earlier.\n\nâ€œThis is where I kissed you last timeâ€, she said, â€œdo you remember?â€ sliding her hands into the front pockets of my jeans like she did the time before. I could feel her hands as they fell deeper inside and pulled me close.\n\nHer lips reached towards mine meeting with another kiss, lasting until the sun set.\n\nThe End','',538,'2015-01-26 14:01:40','2015-01-26 13:04:38',0,1,0),

	(139,42,1,32,'The Dream Walker','\nA stream of guilty thoughts about yesterdayâ€™s dirty lunch date washed over my hands doing tonightâ€™s dishes: rinse and repeat, the monotony reminded me of my marriage. I cook, he eats, I wash, he sleeps, he wakes, we fuck, I sleep and we do it all over again tomorrow. Picking up a plate, circling the sponge in soapy water I once again thought about having that difficult â€œI donâ€™t love you anymoreâ€ conversation with Scott. I have had it inside my head, and heart so many times with myself but always losing my courage. Tonight was no different.\n\nScott was almost asleep in the living room and for a very brief moment I remembered when we did the dishes together, watched tv next to each other on the couch, sometimes falling asleep with my head in his lap. Well, that was almost 11 years ago and things change. I Looked back at him over my shoulder and saw the top of the green pillow  wiggle and his arm flop on top of it. The white noise of dishes and running water in the background was in a way peaceful to us both. We werenâ€™t arguing or having to look at each other with blank feelings for the sake of our son who was eating with us. I looked around and couldnâ€™t see Junior. He must be in his room playing video games with the cat again. It was the perfect time, I thought, the words, Scott we need to talk about things as I pushed his legs aside sitting next to him. They were so close but so afraid of coming out. I lost myself looking out the window, somewhere between where I was and where I wanted to be. \n\nâ€œOh shit,â€ I muttered in a low voice.\nâ€œWhat?â€ Chris mumbled from the couch just about to enter his evening beer-coma. â€œI think I dropped my wedding ring in the sink.â€\n\nLeaning closer into the window, watching a man walk across the street towards the house. He had blue jeans, a black jacket and baseball cap on in. He was unmistakable to me because I just saw Chris yesterday afternoon and drew a white heart on that jacket with a piece of chalk while he looked down into my eyes and told me that he didnâ€™t want me to leave. What is he doing, I asked myself, watching him stop in the middle of the road and stare back at me. I shook my head at him, wet soapy hand on my mouth. His eyes closed and when then opened back up pointing his finger at himself. Then crossed his arms on his chest in an x and pointed a finger at me. I love you he said without words and then disappeared, crossing behind the stop sign on the corner of my front yard. \nI turned off the water and dried my hands. Walking past Scott, I heard his light snoring and noticing his third beer sitting on the coffee table walked lightly to the door, hoping I would get there before the knock or worse the door bell. \n\nI slowed inched the door, a shallow creak in the hinges and watched Chris walk up to me. The screen door separating us. Why are you smiling I thought. â€œWhat are you doing here?â€ I said, â€œyou canâ€™t be here,â€ I told him, looking back towards the living room. â€œItâ€™s dangerous,â€ I whispered through the mesh of the screen, â€œif he wakes up,â€ I paused, pulling the door inside my house closer to me to conceal my voice, â€œif he wakes up and finds you here, he will probably kill you, especially after what you have done.â€\n\nChris stood there smiling at me, â€œWhy are you here?â€ I asked again, â€œplease,â€ I said slightly annoyed and increasingly scared that Scott will wake up any minute now, or Junior will come out looking for one of us. â€œTell me or I am closing this door.â€ \n\nâ€œCome with me,â€ Chris said, holding out his hand. â€œYou told me he abuses you, then leave.â€ My face became blank by his words. â€œItâ€™s not that bad,â€ I replied back and took a deep breath, thinking, I canâ€™t believe this happening, then softly pushed open the front door so it wouldnâ€™t squeak and stood in front of him. I could smell him again and wanted to wrap my arms around him and feel his warm body, run my hands through his short hair, but I couldnâ€™t. The undertow of anger grew inside me and a fear struck me.\n\nâ€œYou know I canâ€™t do that,â€ I answered, â€œnot right now at least,â€ and I put my hand flat on his heart like the day before looking into his eyes with a pleading please, you have to go, but at the same didnâ€™t want him to leave and was secretly walking down the street with him into somewhere else where I was just dreaming. Then I pushed him away, â€œgo.â€ He stepped back taking my arm. I felt his grip not willing to let go. The touch of the black fleece made me remember the day we met at the hotel and I never wanted to leave. I put my hand on his and for the safety of all of us I begged him to leave and I would talk to him tomorrow. â€œHe will kill you,â€ I whispered slowly, fighting back the emotional pull towards him, as he looked into my blue eyes but had no words. â€œPlease,â€ I begged, â€œlet me handle this,â€ kissing him three times; once for every word that I could no longer say out loud: I love you.\n\nI slipped back inside and closed the door. My forehead gently made a thud on the back of the door thinking that I should have went with him; ran out with Junior right then and there and left this bad choice behind, but I canâ€™t just do it. Scott said he would kill him, and me, if I ever I left for him and that he would take everyone I love away from me, including Junior.\nScott slept in his beer nap while I lived in the shadows of his dominance manipulated by fear and coercion.\n\nHe heard a banging in his head like a door knocking and then muffled voices like running water. â€œFine,â€ he said, â€œI will get it,â€ put his beer on the kitchen counter while Christine stared outside washing the dishes like she always does after dinner.\n\nHe opened it and saw him. Dressed in blue jeans, a black jacket and baseball cap. He knew exactly who this intruder of his life was. â€œWhat are you doing here?â€ he asked through the screen door.\nâ€œWhereâ€™s Christine?â€\n\nâ€œGo away,â€ he answered, â€œand donâ€™t come back here again.â€\nHe wasnâ€™t as tall as I thought, maybe 5 foot 6 or 7, wearing an old faded North Face t-shirt in her favorite shade of Navy blue. His hair was a sandy blond like his sons. \n\nâ€œShe told me you abuse her and she wants to leave.â€ \nHis face had a painted expression of anger, anxiety and pride. The memories of her explaining the affair rattled him.\n\nâ€œScott, who is it?â€ Christine asked from the kitchen.  â€œYouâ€™re boyfriend,â€ he replied just before a deafening bang, an metal chime of the shell casing bouncing on the floor.  \n\nâ€œWhat the hell was that,â€ Christine shouted, running to the door. He watched her run through the door, just as we fell to our knees looking at our hands stained red almost in surprise. He watched her lift my head and heard her call my name. Small, rapid footsteps thumped against the new hardwood floors as Junior ran closer, standing next to his dad with holding a gun by his side. \nâ€œMommy, what was that noise?â€ Christine looked back at her son through the screen, â€œgo to your bedroom,â€ she said with a cracking voice. Junior just stood there looking at the blood on her hands, â€œ-now,â€ she yelled and looked back at Scott with fear and anger. â€œYou did what you said you would do. Now take your son to his room and call an ambulance.â€ She turned back to me and wept with anger saying â€œI told you heâ€™d shoot you.â€ She pressed down on the black fleece jack, soaked red, trying to slow the bleeding and looked into his eyes. Through the screen Scott saw her lips moving but couldnâ€™t hear her words, â€œDonâ€™t leave me,â€ she said, â€œI love you and just found you, you impatient idiot.â€\n\nHe took his sonâ€™s hand and disappeared into the delayed sound of someone knocking at the door. He noticed Christine wasnâ€™t at the sink and got off the couch looking for her.\n\nâ€œWho was at the door?â€ I wiped the tears from my eyes and turned around. â€œIt was just a high school kid selling magazines,â€ I answered, â€œand Iâ€™m sorry if our talking woke you up.â€ \n\nHe looked at her with a strange deja-vu confusion and chuckled. â€œYou know I was having the weirdest dream,â€ he said looking into her eyes. â€œYou had an affair and the guy came to the door saying that I abused you and then I shot him and you ran to his side but I couldnâ€™t hear what you were saying to him over the sound of the sirens.â€ \n\nâ€œWell itâ€™s a good thing dreams are only dreams,â€ I answered walking back to the kitchen, â€œand, nothing more.â€\n\nâ€œHey, did you find your ring?,â€ Scott asked from around the corner. I looked at the blue Bud Light Platinum bottle on the coffee table and answered back that Iâ€™ve still got it, slipping it back on my finger, â€œIt didnâ€™t fall too far this time.â€\n\nI stood in front of the sink of cold, soapy water and watched Chris walk away thinking to myself donâ€™t stop trying, one day I will say I do. \n\nThe End','',1665,'2015-01-26 14:36:00','2015-01-26 14:43:17',0,1,0),

What was it you said?\n\nOn that Hill in Reno, you looked me in the eye, told me you loved me and were to ready to change your life. After losing the baby, you told me that your original plan was to have had the baby and then leave Dan, with both Travis and Seth, of which I never knew until that day. I loved you, regardless of the depression, loneliness, fear, emotional &physical trauma and confusion as you now justify as the reason you said what you said to me these past six years, including describing Dan as good provider but controlling and abusive, only later to deny. I wanted to hold you until it all passed, make you safe, warm, comfortable and heal your heart that was broken in so many ways as you did with mine on that morning in Castle Pines. When you hurt so did I and even now the connection I feel to you is surreal. Sadly, the truth I learned the hard way is that you will always protect your fears.\n\nI knew what I risked moving to Roseville to be closer to you and have spent the last year trying to rebuild the relationships with my daughters who I also hurt when I abruptly left their world to try and make another with you. I am sorry for the pain I caused everyone by the cruel, selfish and adolescent things that I did and said trying to make it all happen my way. I honestly believed being closer to you would have given you the strength and courage you always said you couldn\'t find so that you could finally have that conversation with Dan and leave him like I thought I had heard you tell me over and over again. I only need three words to describe what you wrote 12 pages reminding me: I love you too.\n\nI am writing to tell you I am letting go of this crusade to follow my heart back to yours and moving back to Reno next week, and yes, you were worth the risk, and yes, I understand now that it\'s time for us to follow our own destiny.\n\nYou\'re a beautiful and caring woman and I hope you find what you are looking for.

He passed her an inconspicuous glance indicating his disinterest in silence and lack of presence. She smiled with a cute, \"I\'m sorry,\" but all she saw was his email reflected in his glasses. She felt a ponderous sadness pass through her walking down the hall to the bedroom.\n\nThe nightstand lamp dimly lit the room. Above the short, but long bookcase, a tv was mounted on the wall, her jewelry box and a silver necklace laid on the surface along with a family photo from last November. They all wore matching blue jeans and white t-shirts and posed against country style wooden fence, the ground sprinkled by autumn colors. Their smiles hid the exhaustive argument that had on the way to the park. A circular votive candle holder hung over the bed but never used. The bed was made, as she always made it after they showered in the morning, and a small chair sat in each corner of the bedroom with her night shirt flung over one of them and his sweat pants on the other. Slippers tucked underneath. \n\nUndressing from the day, she pulled the night shirt over her heard and kneeled beside the bed pulling out an old shoe box that had a large orange sales sticker on it. She took out a small brown leather journal then pushed the box back where she kept it hidden from everyone; sometimes even herself.\n\nTossing the sheets aside, she laid down and opened the journal.\n\nAugust 14, 2009\n\"Okay, you can give me a hug,\" she said to me, looking at me warmly with eyes smiling from the inside out and a voice that I knew. Our hearts beat against each other. I didnâ€™t want to let go as our hearts made out like love-crazy teenagers, and stood there in the middle of the Subway parking lot captivated by one another until our arms fell to their sides holding hands. I glanced down and saw our fingers interlocked in a sweet yet complicated reunion, then back into her blue eyes where I am forever found. The tan line on her finger explained what she wouldn\'t tell me until I drove 1,374 miles to see her. It was too already too late because it didn\'t matter to either one of us. We had already fallen in love with no more than a hug and touch of the hand, and I knew that I wanted was to take her with me into the rest of my life. On the drive back to California she texted, \"I want to feel you inside me.\" A tease that lead to the most enjoyable drive through the Great Salt Lake. #end\n\nRemember the sexting of that day, her cheeks blushed the color of her lipstick which she hadn\'t taken off yet, bite the corner of her lower lip, touching herself in a way she also remembered him touching her on that midnight rendezvous outside the movie theater and then again in the hotel room a month later.\n\nShe turned the page, moistening her fingers and sliding them under her shorts and kept reading. The soft brush of her wet finger feeling her sensitive skin. A tickle sensation flowed through her body while she massaged herself slowly with one hand, turning pages of the journal with the other. \n\nA soft moan as her finger moved slightly faster, a light tingling sensation building as fingers became wetter and dipped into her discovering a warm, sticky pleasure. \n\nShe turned the next page.\n\nSeptember 15, 2009.\nI can\'t explain how wonderful today was. After another really long 17 hour, stop for gas and pee-break only drive she stood in front me with those angelic eyes and immediately grabbed my lips with hers. \"Do you have any music?\" she asked me. I opened the laptop on the nightstand next to me and put on the playlist she made for me: Keep Me In Your Thoughts by Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers filled the room. She stood at the foot of the bed, shoulder length blonde hair looking me in nothing but her blue panties and matching bra and seductive \"come and get me\" smile. My eyes lusting up and down her petite body as it crawled on top of me taking my lips into her mouth. She held me, hard, moving her hand, while my erection grew longer and my hand slipped under her panties feeling the warm, wet, sticky pleasure of her sex, finger sinking slowly inside her fire. She moaned and rocked her hips a few times then spun on top of me, grinding her warm, moist sex against my balls. Her boobs looked down at me filling her bra and wiggling to pop out into my hands. She rubbed down against me harder letting the tip slide inside her, slippery and warm. After a few pokes I pushed inside her, then back slowly, starting a rhythm: up and down, back and forth. She gyrated her hips whispering, \"I love how you feel inside me,\" as the sensation spread, swinging her hips back into me again. I felt the tip touch a soft pillow. It was warm, tingling, erotic. I held it there feeling the inside of wet and happy flower suck the tip the of my penis, tight, warm and hot. She squeezed her legs into my side and moaned, \"I want to feel you cum inside me,\" and I rolled on top of her. I unsnapped her bra. She wiggled it off her arms my hand cupping her squishy boobs, my thumbs circling her nipples; our mouths open and tongues tango.  We start the pattern again: left to right and up and down, and down again and slowly in and out. A sensuous tempo. The pleasure desiring to release tickled by a growing sensation from my toes to my finger tips which firmly sat on her belly, balancing me as I moved inside her somewhere in between slow and then deep and faster and then slower until her finger nails lightly ran down my shoulders and sides of my back while her soul was massaged by an exhaustive orgasm. I was about to cum and pushed deep inside her until I felt that soft, warm pillow of love surrounded by our warm release. My lips buried in her neck, feeling completely vulnerable yet totally satisfied.  She whispered, \"I love you\". #end\n\nShe slipped her hand out from under panties back over her belly and between her breasts with a self-satisfied sigh. His silhouette stood in the door watching her.\n\n\"What are you reading?\" he asked with a curiosity and stretched himself out on the bed beside her. His hand rested on top of her bare, naked leg stroking its smoothness along the inside of her thigh. She was wet and aroused from the story, sensitive to his touch. She shivered and took a long breath before returning him a seductive smile and closed the pages of the brown journal. \n\nLicking her fingers she reached through his boxers, rubbing his dick hard while circling her tongue with his and then along his lips in a long passionate kiss. His hand rushed over her belly button under her shirt grabbing her breasts, squeezing them and then down again between her legs tugging her panties from around her knees. She slid her back down the pillow flipping him and he dropped on top of her; his boxers tugged off with her feet and she opened her legs on each side of him. He easily fell inside her wet sensuous pleasure.\n\nShe moaned quietly to herself staring at the ceiling while he rocked in and out; wet, smooth, warm and fast. She put her hand on his shoulder escaping back into the memories, the words she just read while waiting for him to finish.

He passed her an inconspicuous glance indicating his disinterest in silence and lack of presence. She smiled with a cute, \"I\'m sorry,\" but all she saw was his email reflected in his glasses. She felt a ponderous sadness pass through her walking down the hall to the bedroom.\n\nThe nightstand lamp dimly lit the room. Above the short, but long bookcase, a tv was mounted on the wall, her jewelry box and a silver necklace laid on the surface along with a family photo from last November. They all wore matching blue jeans and white t-shirts and posed against country style wooden fence, the ground sprinkled by autumn colors. Their smiles hid the exhaustive argument that had on the way to the park. A circular votive candle holder hung over the bed but never used. The bed was made, as she always made it after they showered in the morning, and a small chair sat in each corner of the bedroom with her night shirt flung over one of them and his sweat pants on the other. Slippers tucked underneath. \n\nUndressing from the day, she pulled the night shirt over her heard and kneeled beside the bed pulling out an old shoe box that had a large orange sales sticker on it. She took out a small brown leather journal then pushed the box back where she kept it hidden from everyone; sometimes even herself.\n\nTossing the sheets aside, she laid down and opened the journal.\n\nAugust 14, 2009\n\"Okay, you can give me a hug,\" she said to me, looking at me warmly with eyes smiling from the inside out and a voice that I knew. Our hearts beat against each other. I didnâ€™t want to let go as our hearts made out like love-crazy teenagers, and stood there in the middle of the Subway parking lot captivated by one another until our arms fell to their sides holding hands. I glanced down and saw our fingers interlocked in a sweet yet complicated reunion, then back into her blue eyes where I am forever found. The tan line on her finger explained what she wouldn\'t tell me until I drove 1,374 miles to see her. It was too already too late because it didn\'t matter to either one of us. We had already fallen in love with no more than a hug and touch of the hand, and I knew that I wanted was to take her with me into the rest of my life. On the drive back to California she texted, \"I want to feel you inside me.\" A tease that lead to the most enjoyable drive through the Great Salt Lake. #end\n\nRemember the sexting of that day, her cheeks blushed the color of her lipstick which she hadn\'t taken off yet, bite the corner of her lower lip, touching herself in a way she also remembered him touching her on that midnight rendezvous outside the movie theater and then again in the hotel room a month later.\n\nShe turned the page, moistening her fingers and sliding them under her shorts and kept reading. The soft brush of her wet finger feeling her sensitive skin. A tickle sensation flowed through her body while she massaged herself slowly with one hand, turning pages of the journal with the other. \n\nA soft moan as her finger moved slightly faster, a light tingling sensation building as fingers became wetter and dipped into her discovering a warm, sticky pleasure. \n\nShe turned the next page.\n\nSeptember 15, 2009.\nI can\'t explain how wonderful today was. After another really long 17 hour, stop for gas and pee-break only drive she stood in front me with those angelic eyes and immediately grabbed my lips with hers. \"Do you have any music?\" she asked me. I opened the laptop on the nightstand next to me and put on the playlist she made for me: Keep Me In Your Thoughts by Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers filled the room. She stood at the foot of the bed, shoulder length blonde hair looking me in nothing but her blue panties and matching bra and seductive \"come and get me\" smile. My eyes lusting up and down her petite body as it crawled on top of me taking my lips into her mouth. She held me, hard, moving her hand, while my erection grew longer and my hand slipped under her panties feeling the warm, wet, sticky pleasure of her sex, finger sinking slowly inside her fire. She moaned and rocked her hips a few times then spun on top of me, grinding her warm, moist sex against my balls. Her boobs looked down at me filling her bra and wiggling to pop out into my hands. She rubbed down against me harder letting the tip slide inside her, slippery and warm. After a few pokes I pushed inside her, then back slowly, starting a rhythm: up and down, back and forth. She gyrated her hips whispering, \"I love how you feel inside me,\" as the sensation spread, swinging her hips back into me again. I felt the tip touch a soft pillow. It was warm, tingling, erotic. I held it there feeling the inside of wet and happy flower suck the tip the of my penis, tight, warm and hot. She squeezed her legs into my side and moaned, \"I want to feel you cum inside me,\" and I rolled on top of her. I unsnapped her bra. She wiggled it off her arms my hand cupping her squishy boobs, my thumbs circling her nipples; our mouths open and tongues tango.  We start the pattern again: left to right and up and down, and down again and slowly in and out. A sensuous tempo. The pleasure desiring to release tickled by a growing sensation from my toes to my finger tips which firmly sat on her belly, balancing me as I moved inside her somewhere in between slow and then deep and faster and then slower until her finger nails lightly ran down my shoulders and sides of my back while her soul was massaged by an exhaustive orgasm. I was about to cum and pushed deep inside her until I felt that soft, warm pillow of love surrounded by our warm release. My lips buried in her neck, feeling completely vulnerable yet totally satisfied.  She whispered, \"I love you\". #end\n\nShe slipped her hand out from under panties back over her belly and between her breasts with a self-satisfied sigh. His silhouette stood in the door watching her.\n\n\"What are you reading?\" he asked with a curiosity and stretched himself out on the bed beside her. His hand rested on top of her bare, naked leg stroking its smoothness along the inside of her thigh. She was wet and aroused from the story, sensitive to his touch. She shivered and took a long breath before returning him a seductive smile and closed the pages of the brown journal. \n\nLicking her fingers she reached through his boxers, rubbing his dick hard while circling her tongue with his and then along his lips in a long passionate kiss. His hand rushed over her belly button under her shirt grabbing her breasts, squeezing them and then down again between her legs tugging her panties from around her knees. She slid her back down the pillow flipping him and he dropped on top of her; his boxers tugged off with her feet and she opened her legs on each side of him. He easily fell inside her wet sensuous pleasure.\n\nShe moaned quietly to herself staring at the ceiling while he rocked in and out; wet, smooth, warm and fast. She put her hand on his shoulder escaping back into the memories, the words she just read while waiting for him to finish.

She took out a small brown leather journal then pushed the box back where she kept it hidden from everyone; sometimes even herself.\n\nTossing the sheets aside, she laid down and opened the journal.\n\nAugust 14, 2009\n\"Okay, you can give me a hug,\" she said to me, looking at me warmly with eyes smiling from the inside out and a voice that I knew. Our hearts beat against each other. I didnâ€™t want to let go as our hearts made out like love-crazy teenagers, and stood there in the middle of the Subway parking lot captivated by one another until our arms fell to their sides holding hands. I glanced down and saw our fingers interlocked in a sweet yet complicated reunion, then back into her blue eyes where I am forever found. The tan line on her finger explained what she wouldn\'t tell me until I drove 1,374 miles to see her. It was too already too late because it didn\'t matter to either one of us. We had already fallen in love with no more than a hug and touch of the hand, and I knew that I wanted was to take her with me into the rest of my life. On the drive back to California she texted, \"I want to feel you inside me.\" A tease that lead to the most enjoyable drive through the Great Salt Lake. #end\n\nRemember the sexting of that day, her cheeks blushed the color of her lipstick which she hadn\'t taken off yet, bite the corner of her lower lip, touching herself in a way she also remembered him touching her on that midnight rendezvous outside the movie theater and then again in the hotel room a month later.\n\nShe turned the page, moistening her fingers and sliding them under her shorts and kept reading. The soft brush of her wet finger feeling her sensitive skin. A tickle sensation flowed through her body while she massaged herself slowly with one hand, turning pages of the journal with the other. \n\nA soft moan as her finger moved slightly faster, a light tingling sensation building as fingers became wetter and dipped into her discovering a warm, sticky pleasure. \n\nShe turned the next page.\n\nSeptember 15, 2009.\nI can\'t explain how wonderful today was. After another really long 17 hour, stop for gas and pee-break only drive she stood in front me with those angelic eyes and immediately grabbed my lips with hers. \"Do you have any music?\" she asked me. I opened the laptop on the nightstand next to me and put on the playlist she made for me: Keep Me In Your Thoughts by Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers filled the room. She stood at the foot of the bed, shoulder length blonde hair looking me in nothing but her blue panties and matching bra and seductive \"come and get me\" smile. My eyes lusting up and down her petite body as it crawled on top of me taking my lips into her mouth. She held me, hard, moving her hand, while my erection grew longer and my hand slipped under her panties feeling the warm, wet, sticky pleasure of her sex, finger sinking slowly inside her fire. She moaned and rocked her hips a few times then spun on top of me, grinding her warm, moist sex against my balls. Her boobs looked down at me filling her bra and wiggling to pop out into my hands. She rubbed down against me harder letting the tip slide inside her, slippery and warm. After a few pokes I pushed inside her, then back slowly, starting a rhythm: up and down, back and forth. She gyrated her hips whispering, \"I love how you feel inside me,\" as the sensation spread, swinging her hips back into me again. I felt the tip touch a soft pillow. It was warm, tingling, erotic. I held it there feeling the inside of wet and happy flower suck the tip the of my penis, tight, warm and hot. She squeezed her legs into my side and moaned, \"I want to feel you cum inside me,\" and I rolled on top of her. I unsnapped her bra. She wiggled it off her arms my hand cupping her squishy boobs, my thumbs circling her nipples; our mouths open and tongues tango.  We start the pattern again: left to right and up and down, and down again and slowly in and out. A sensuous tempo. The pleasure desiring to release tickled by a growing sensation from my toes to my finger tips which firmly sat on her belly, balancing me as I moved inside her somewhere in between slow and then deep and faster and then slower until her finger nails lightly ran down my shoulders and sides of my back while her soul was massaged by an exhaustive orgasm. I was about to cum and pushed deep inside her until I felt that soft, warm pillow of love surrounded by our warm release. My lips buried in her neck, feeling completely vulnerable yet totally satisfied.  She whispered, \"I love you\". #end\n\nShe slipped her hand out from under panties back over her belly and between her breasts with a self-satisfied sigh. His silhouette stood in the door watching her.\n\n\"What are you reading?\" he asked with a curiosity and stretched himself out on the bed beside her. His hand rested on top of her bare, naked leg stroking its smoothness along the inside of her thigh. She was wet and aroused from the story, sensitive to his touch. She shivered and took a long breath before returning him a seductive smile and closed the pages of the brown journal. \n\nLicking her fingers she reached through his boxers, rubbing his dick hard while circling her tongue with his and then along his lips in a long passionate kiss. His hand rushed over her belly button under her shirt grabbing her breasts, squeezing them and then down again between her legs tugging her panties from around her knees. She slid her back down the pillow flipping him and he dropped on top of her; his boxers tugged off with her feet and she opened her legs on each side of him. He easily fell inside her wet sensuous pleasure.\n\nShe moaned quietly to herself staring at the ceiling while he rocked in and out; wet, smooth, warm and fast. She put her hand on his shoulder escaping back into the memories, the words she just read while waiting for him to finish.

It\'s not the lies that you buried in the dirt from who, it\'s who you buried them with that hurts. Dig a hole, plant my heart and maybe with a little wet sunshine it will start to grow again.\n\nw: I Saw You Today, by James McCarthy\nYou came to me this morning, sometime between 3:24 AM and 4:48 AM, in between a dream, and cuddled against me. We spoke no words, just sat in the darkness, street light flickering outside the window behind us, your head rested against my chest, my fingers combing through your hair until you fell asleep and then had to leave. Your warmth and beautiful perfume I will carry with me the day through; a moment our souls connected somewhere between together.\n\nw: Christmas Eve, by James McCarthy\nShe poured her fourth glass of wine, a Primal Roots Red Blend, 2009, and from the kitchen said, \"oh, Santa, there will be sex tonight,\" carrying two glasses back to the twinkling Christmas tree. Santa was done with Christmas and sleeping on the couch. She put his glass on the table, speaking softly, \"without you I guess,\" walking into the bedroom alone.\n\nh: Don\'t Believe Yourself, by Aime White\nA pain emerged, screaming, a deafening cry / long, soft eyelashes pressed together like our hands / A soft breeze from an ocean wave, carried her into a dream, where a beautiful woman stood, dressed in all white, a veil hiding her face, eyes for someone else, her soul could only see / A voice spoke, asking \"if we do?\", head faintly nodding, kissing the whole night through / A feeling exploded inside, praying \"please I changed my mind\" / \"why do I keep this heart hidden away, locked in silence, when he\'s there in every blink of my eye, emerging from my every thought\" / two people, two hearts, beating in different time, waiting to harmonize / love\n\nw: The Heart And The Head, by James McCarthy\nDisgusted, she watched him sitting on the couch, contemplating the idea: \"I pretend you don\'t exist in between the moments that you must.\" Not moving his eyes from the tv, he felt her brooding stare and asked, \"What are you thinking?\" She stared hopeless at him and answered, \"Kiss me,\" stuck in between that moment.\n\nw: Love > Fear, Jason Black\n\"I have a new dream to follow and it\'s not going to be mislead by you again\", he said, looking into her blue eyes tearing grey. Her stare was blank and silent, hearts cold as the air around them. He walked away, but then stopped four steps later, looked at her bundled in a blue peacoat, blonde hair kicking at her shoulders with the wind, and spoke his last words to her so she would understand without doubt, \"Say Something, or I\'m giving up on you.\" She let him walk away chilled by the scared feeling inside her heart.\n\nw: \nTruth Washed Down The Drain, by Juliet Rose \nThe water streamed over her hands while she looked through the kitchen window. â€œOh shit,â€ she muttered out loud. â€œWhat?â€ her husband asked. â€œI think I just dropped my wedding ring down the drain,â€ she replied, watching him cross street towards her home. â€œWell, if you cared, you would have taken it off.â€ The door bell rang. â€œIâ€™ll get it,â€ she responded, â€œI just forgot, Iâ€™m sorry.â€ (Author note: this inspired the short story A Change of Heart published online at No More Black Tea)\n\nh: Walking Huffaker Hill that November Day, scratched by Jess Mahaney\nLet me take you to the mountain top, where you can share a dream of me, where it shared a dream of you / divinatory / escaping the complexity that defines our days and disavowed nights / for if we stood just a moment, on that mountain top again, we will share a lifetime together, a kiss you will believe / tumbling down the rocks, two clumsy searching souls, caught by fate, reunited heart, no matter how many times it climbs and falls / once again kismet wails in the Nevada wind, blowing over the mountain top / sweetening our salty lips','',747,'2014-05-25 20:52:07','2014-06-08 18:08:14',0,0,0),

A summer breeze lifting the thin blonde strands around her shoulders dancing with the tune she hummed to herself -- lost in her own little 7-year old world. Giggling, she answered back, \"but they love them, mommy, look\" and tossed another at the small black birds with white feathers. They pecked at the ground flipping french fries into the air, each taking a turn at a small bite.\n\n\"The big gray ones are mean,\" she said, pointing to the Canadian Geese, \"soosh, go away mean ones. no french fries for you, only the little baby ones.\" \n\nSara smiled, admiring her beautiful daughter take another french fry from the white paper pouch. \"Yes, they look so happy eating your lunch,\" she said smiling back.

	(89,43,2,1,1,'Bedside Manners','\"I\'m going to read\" she said bumping his laptop with her foot by accident while slipping off the couch. He passed her an inconspicuous glance indicating his disinterest in silence and lack of presence. She smiled with a cute, \"I\'m sorry,\" but all she saw was his email reflected in his glasses. She felt a ponderous sadness pass through her walking down the hall to the bedroom.\n\nThe nightstand lamp dimly lit the room. Above the short, but long bookcase, a tv was mounted on the wall, her jewelry box and a silver necklace laid on the surface along with a family photo from last November. They all wore matching blue jeans and white t-shirts and posed against country style wooden fence, the ground sprinkled by autumn colors. Their smiles hid the exhaustive argument that had on the way to the park. A circular votive candle holder hung over the bed but never used. The bed was made, as she always made it after they showered in the morning, and a small chair sat in each corner of the bedroom with her night shirt flung over one of them and his sweat pants on the other. Slippers tucked underneath. \n\nUndressing from the day, she pulled the night shirt over her heard and kneeled beside the bed pulling out an old shoe box that had a large orange sales sticker on it. She took out a small brown leather journal then pushed the box back where she kept it hidden from everyone; sometimes even herself.\n\nTossing the sheets aside, she laid down and opened the journal.\n\nAugust 14, 2009\n\"Okay, you can give me a hug,\" she said to me, looking at me warmly with eyes smiling from the inside out and a voice that I knew. Our hearts beat against each other. I didnâ€™t want to let go as our hearts made out like love-crazy teenagers, and stood there in the middle of the Subway parking lot captivated by one another until our arms fell to their sides holding hands. I glanced down and saw our fingers interlocked in a sweet yet complicated reunion, then back into her blue eyes where I am forever found. The tan line on her finger explained what she wouldn\'t tell me until I drove 1,374 miles to see her. It was too already too late because it didn\'t matter to either one of us. We had already fallen in love with no more than a hug and touch of the hand, and I knew that I wanted was to take her with me into the rest of my life. On the drive back to California she texted, \"I want to feel you inside me.\" A tease that lead to the most enjoyable drive through the Great Salt Lake. #end\n\nRemember the sexting of that day, her cheeks blushed the color of her lipstick which she hadn\'t taken off yet, bite the corner of her lower lip, touching herself in a way she also remembered him touching her on that midnight rendezvous outside the movie theater and then again in the hotel room a month later.\n\nShe turned the page, moistening her fingers and sliding them under her shorts and kept reading. The soft brush of her wet finger feeling her sensitive skin. A tickle sensation flowed through her body while she massaged herself slowly with one hand, turning pages of the journal with the other. \n\nA soft moan as her finger moved slightly faster, a light tingling sensation building as fingers became wetter and dipped into her discovering a warm, sticky pleasure. \n\nShe turned the next page.\n\nSeptember 15, 2009.\nI can\'t explain how wonderful today was. After another really long 17 hour, stop for gas and pee-break only drive she stood in front me with those angelic eyes and immediately grabbed my lips with hers. \"Do you have any music?\" she asked me. I opened the laptop on the nightstand next to me and put on the playlist she made for me: Keep Me In Your Thoughts by Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers filled the room. She stood at the foot of the bed, shoulder length blonde hair looking me in nothing but her blue panties and matching bra and seductive \"come and get me\" smile. My eyes lusting up and down her petite body as it crawled on top of me taking my lips into her mouth. She held me, hard, moving her hand, while my erection grew longer and my hand slipped under her panties feeling the warm, wet, sticky pleasure of her sex, finger sinking slowly inside her fire. She moaned and rocked her hips a few times then spun on top of me, grinding her warm, moist sex against my balls. Her boobs looked down at me filling her bra and wiggling to pop out into my hands. She rubbed down against me harder letting the tip slide inside her, slippery and warm. After a few pokes I pushed inside her, then back slowly, starting a rhythm: up and down, back and forth. She gyrated her hips whispering, \"I love how you feel inside me,\" as the sensation spread, swinging her hips back into me again. I felt the tip touch a soft pillow. It was warm, tingling, erotic. I held it there feeling the inside of wet and happy flower suck the tip the of my penis, tight, warm and hot. She squeezed her legs into my side and moaned, \"I want to feel you cum inside me,\" and I rolled on top of her. I unsnapped her bra. She wiggled it off her arms my hand cupping her squishy boobs, my thumbs circling her nipples; our mouths open and tongues tango.  We start the pattern again: left to right and up and down, and down again and slowly in and out. A sensuous tempo. The pleasure desiring to release tickled by a growing sensation from my toes to my finger tips which firmly sat on her belly, balancing me as I moved inside her somewhere in between slow and then deep and faster and then slower until her finger nails lightly ran down my shoulders and sides of my back while her soul was massaged by an exhaustive orgasm. I was about to cum and pushed deep inside her until I felt that soft, warm pillow of love surrounded by our warm release. My lips buried in her neck, feeling completely vulnerable yet totally satisfied.  She whispered, \"I love you\". #end\n\nShe slipped her hand out from under panties back over her belly and between her breasts with a self-satisfied sigh. His silhouette stood in the door watching her.\n\n\"What are you reading?\" he asked with a curiosity and stretched himself out on the bed beside her. His hand rested on top of her bare, naked leg stroking its smoothness along the inside of her thigh. She was wet and aroused from the story, sensitive to his touch. She shivered and took a long breath before returning him a seductive smile and closed the pages of the brown journal. \n\nLicking her fingers she reached through his boxers, rubbing his dick hard while circling her tongue with his and then along his lips in a long passionate kiss. His hand rushed over her belly button under her shirt grabbing her breasts, squeezing them and then down again between her legs tugging her panties from around her knees. She slid her back down the pillow flipping him and he dropped on top of her; his boxers tugged off with her feet and she opened her legs on each side of him. He easily fell inside her wet sensuous pleasure.\n\nShe moaned quietly to herself staring at the ceiling while he rocked in and out; wet, smooth, warm and fast. She put her hand on his shoulder escaping back into the memories, the words she just read while waiting for him to finish.

It\'s not the lies that you buried in the dirt from who, it\'s who you buried them with that hurts. Dig a hole, plant my heart and maybe with a little wet sunshine it will start to grow again.\n\nw: I Saw You Today, by James McCarthy\nYou came to me this morning, sometime between 3:24 AM and 4:48 AM, in between a dream, and cuddled against me. We spoke no words, just sat in the darkness, street light flickering outside the window behind us, your head rested against my chest, my fingers combing through your hair until you fell asleep and then had to leave. Your warmth and beautiful perfume I will carry with me the day through; a moment our souls connected somewhere between together.\n\nw: Christmas Eve, by James McCarthy\nShe poured her fourth glass of wine, a Primal Roots Red Blend, 2009, and from the kitchen said, \"oh, Santa, there will be sex tonight,\" carrying two glasses back to the twinkling Christmas tree.

Her stare was blank and silent, hearts cold as the air around them. He walked away, but then stopped four steps later, looked at her bundled in a blue peacoat, blonde hair kicking at her shoulders with the wind, and spoke his last words to her so she would understand without doubt, \"Say Something, or I\'m giving up on you.\" She let him walk away chilled by the scared feeling inside her heart.\n\nw: \nTruth Washed Down The Drain, by Juliet Rose \nThe water streamed over her hands while she looked through the kitchen window. â€œOh shit,â€ she muttered out loud. â€œWhat?â€ her husband asked. â€œI think I just dropped my wedding ring down the drain,â€ she replied, watching him cross street towards her home. â€œWell, if you cared, you would have taken it off.â€ The door bell rang. â€œIâ€™ll get it,â€ she responded, â€œI just forgot, Iâ€™m sorry.â€ (Author note: this inspired the short story A Change of Heart published online at No More Black Tea)\n\nh: Walking Huffaker Hill that November Day, scratched by Jess Mahaney\nLet me take you to the mountain top, where you can share a dream of me, where it shared a dream of you / divinatory / escaping the complexity that defines our days and disavowed nights / for if we stood just a moment, on that mountain top again, we will share a lifetime together, a kiss you will believe / tumbling down the rocks, two clumsy searching souls, caught by fate, reunited heart, no matter how many times it climbs and falls / once again kismet wails in the Nevada wind, blowing over the mountain top / sweetening our salty lips','',747,'2014-05-25 20:52:07','2014-06-08 18:08:14',0,0,0),

	(106,43,2,1,1,'Bedside Manners','\"I\'m going to read\" she said bumping his laptop with her foot by accident while slipping off the couch. He passed her an inconspicuous glance indicating his disinterest in silence and lack of presence. She smiled with a cute, \"I\'m sorry,\" but all she saw was his email reflected in his glasses. She felt a ponderous sadness pass through her walking down the hall to the bedroom.\n\nThe nightstand lamp dimly lit the room. Above the short, but long bookcase, a tv was mounted on the wall, her jewelry box and a silver necklace laid on the surface along with a family photo from last November. They all wore matching blue jeans and white t-shirts and posed against country style wooden fence, the ground sprinkled by autumn colors. Their smiles hid the exhaustive argument that had on the way to the park. A circular votive candle holder hung over the bed but never used. The bed was made, as she always made it after they showered in the morning, and a small chair sat in each corner of the bedroom with her night shirt flung over one of them and his sweat pants on the other. Slippers tucked underneath. \n\nUndressing from the day, she pulled the night shirt over her heard and kneeled beside the bed pulling out an old shoe box that had a large orange sales sticker on it. She took out a small brown leather journal then pushed the box back where she kept it hidden from everyone; sometimes even herself.\n\nTossing the sheets aside, she laid down and opened the journal.\n\nAugust 14, 2009\n\"Okay, you can give me a hug,\" she said to me, looking at me warmly with eyes smiling from the inside out and a voice that I knew. Our hearts beat against each other. I didnâ€™t want to let go as our hearts made out like love-crazy teenagers, and stood there in the middle of the Subway parking lot captivated by one another until our arms fell to their sides holding hands. I glanced down and saw our fingers interlocked in a sweet yet complicated reunion, then back into her blue eyes where I am forever found. The tan line on her finger explained what she wouldn\'t tell me until I drove 1,374 miles to see her. It was too already too late because it didn\'t matter to either one of us. We had already fallen in love with no more than a hug and touch of the hand, and I knew that I wanted was to take her with me into the rest of my life. On the drive back to California she texted, \"I want to feel you inside me.\" A tease that lead to the most enjoyable drive through the Great Salt Lake. #end\n\nRemember the sexting of that day, her cheeks blushed the color of her lipstick which she hadn\'t taken off yet, bite the corner of her lower lip, touching herself in a way she also remembered him touching her on that midnight rendezvous outside the movie theater and then again in the hotel room a month later.\n\nShe turned the page, moistening her fingers and sliding them under her shorts and kept reading. The soft brush of her wet finger feeling her sensitive skin. A tickle sensation flowed through her body while she massaged herself slowly with one hand, turning pages of the journal with the other. \n\nA soft moan as her finger moved slightly faster, a light tingling sensation building as fingers became wetter and dipped into her discovering a warm, sticky pleasure. \n\nShe turned the next page.\n\nSeptember 15, 2009.\nI can\'t explain how wonderful today was. After another really long 17 hour, stop for gas and pee-break only drive she stood in front me with those angelic eyes and immediately grabbed my lips with hers. \"Do you have any music?\" she asked me. I opened the laptop on the nightstand next to me and put on the playlist she made for me: Keep Me In Your Thoughts by Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers filled the room. She stood at the foot of the bed, shoulder length blonde hair looking me in nothing but her blue panties and matching bra and seductive \"come and get me\" smile. My eyes lusting up and down her petite body as it crawled on top of me taking my lips into her mouth. She held me, hard, moving her hand, while my erection grew longer and my hand slipped under her panties feeling the warm, wet, sticky pleasure of her sex, finger sinking slowly inside her fire. She moaned and rocked her hips a few times then spun on top of me, grinding her warm, moist sex against my balls. Her boobs looked down at me filling her bra and wiggling to pop out into my hands. She rubbed down against me harder letting the tip slide inside her, slippery and warm. After a few pokes I pushed inside her, then back slowly, starting a rhythm: up and down, back and forth. She gyrated her hips whispering, \"I love how you feel inside me,\" as the sensation spread, swinging her hips back into me again. I felt the tip touch a soft pillow. It was warm, tingling, erotic. I held it there feeling the inside of wet and happy flower suck the tip the of my penis, tight, warm and hot. She squeezed her legs into my side and moaned, \"I want to feel you cum inside me,\" and I rolled on top of her. I unsnapped her bra. She wiggled it off her arms my hand cupping her squishy boobs, my thumbs circling her nipples; our mouths open and tongues tango.  We start the pattern again: left to right and up and down, and down again and slowly in and out. A sensuous tempo. The pleasure desiring to release tickled by a growing sensation from my toes to my finger tips which firmly sat on her belly, balancing me as I moved inside her somewhere in between slow and then deep and faster and then slower until her finger nails lightly ran down my shoulders and sides of my back while her soul was massaged by an exhaustive orgasm. I was about to cum and pushed deep inside her until I felt that soft, warm pillow of love surrounded by our warm release. My lips buried in her neck, feeling completely vulnerable yet totally satisfied.  She whispered, \"I love you\". #end\n\nShe slipped her hand out from under panties back over her belly and between her breasts with a self-satisfied sigh. His silhouette stood in the door watching her.\n\n\"What are you reading?\" he asked with a curiosity and stretched himself out on the bed beside her. His hand rested on top of her bare, naked leg stroking its smoothness along the inside of her thigh. She was wet and aroused from the story, sensitive to his touch. She shivered and took a long breath before returning him a seductive smile and closed the pages of the brown journal. \n\nLicking her fingers she reached through his boxers, rubbing his dick hard while circling her tongue with his and then along his lips in a long passionate kiss. His hand rushed over her belly button under her shirt grabbing her breasts, squeezing them and then down again between her legs tugging her panties from around her knees. She slid her back down the pillow flipping him and he dropped on top of her; his boxers tugged off with her feet and she opened her legs on each side of him. He easily fell inside her wet sensuous pleasure.\n\nShe moaned quietly to herself staring at the ceiling while he rocked in and out; wet, smooth, warm and fast. She put her hand on his shoulder escaping back into the memories, the words she just read while waiting for him to finish.

	(121,78,2,1,1,'How To Break The Platinum Promise',' I drove into the office parking lot not really wanting to be here but after being forced to confess my affair I didn\'t have much of a choice. It was either leave the marriage or work it out; even if my heart really wasn\'t in it any more. Divorce is something I don\'t want to put my son through having been part of a broken family myself as well as having a mother who abandoned me. This is why I am looking for a parking spot, doing what I think is right, yet never more confused about anything in my life.\n\nCircling a few rows of cars, I finally pulled into a spot in the back where Scott could easily see me. The leaves on the trees were hanging heavy from the rain and run-off rushed like a mini river down the roads edge. It was nice to sit and watch the rain express how I felt inside.\n\nIronic, I thought, as listened to Adele\'s \"Someone Like You\" fill the interior around me. A cool mist tickled my cheek as rain spit inside from the cracked window next to me while I waited and cried and thought more about why I was here and whether I sincerely wanted to be here.\n\nSo this is what it looks like to cry from the inside I thought watching the water bead and stream down the windshield. Why am I here I kept thinking to myself. The music washing out the sound of the rain of my confusion. The song\'s lyrics soaking into my head with vivid dream-like memories of those days which I am told to forget.\n\n\"I heard that you\'re settled down / That you found a girl and you\'re married now / I heard that your dreams came true / Guess she gave you things I didn\'t give to you\"\n\nThose lyrics are right, I thought, I\'m married now, looking at my ring, turning it slightly with my thumb, thinking about the drive through the mountains with Josh and when I shared the story about how I picked the platinum wedding band of blue sapphires out myself; how I told my bridesmaid getting into the limo after the ceremony that I couldn\'t do this; how it\'s not that I love him that matters, but how -- an internal conflict of pride, guilt and submissive duty.\n\n\"Regrets and mistakes, they\'re memories made / Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?\"\n\nHis truck pulled up my beside my car. I wiped the tears and rain from my eyes and turned off Adele. We ran through the rain into the counselor\'s office.\n\nA degree in Marriage and Family Counseling hung on the wall over his desk. A country style couch with light green and blue flowers sat across from a low back, espresso colored swivel chair and side table with a yellow coffee cup and spiral notebook. He sat down with a smile and began our first counseling session.\n\nI was here in mind, as they say, but not in heart. I knew this and also knew that I had to play the game in order to stay with my son and keep Scott from getting mad. He\'s a good provider, but not a nice man when you cross him. His words often shameful and disrespectful; controlling. Scary.\n\n\"The rain is change today?\" the counselor asked smiling at us. We leaned against the sofa\'s arms, legs crossed, sitting at opposite sides. I held a pillow thinking to myself again, I have to be here for my son. He deserves the best life possible.\n\n\"How long have you two been married?\" the counselor asked, picking up his notebook from the side table. There was an awkward moment of silence of eyes staring the gray carpet.\n\n\"8 years,\" my husband finally answered. His voice, a tone of disappointment. I can\'t imagine how he felt after my betrayal, but it didn\'t feel like I was betraying him. I didn\'t really even think about it. It felt right. It felt like I had just found the person who was always missing in my life and what I was doing really didn\'t become real until that night I got the text: \"Tell him or I will.\" I realized then that I was trying to escape from something I didn\'t want to understand. My husband and I are happy, I told myself again, half aware of the continuing awkward silence of the room. I know we are happy, but I don\'t feel like on the inside; I feel alone.\n\nChristine, the counselor spoke, noticing my apparent lack of engagement in the conversation. \"There are 10 emotional needs that every marriage must meet,\" he continued, \"do you know what they are?\" I looked up from the carpet stare with a depressed smile and shook my head no. He returned an empathetic grin. The words \"let me explain them,\" followed. As he spoke I thought about each one.\n\n#1: Affection, One More Year\nHe walked over to me and leaned in for a kiss. I sighed and put one arm around him, patting his shoulder and asked \"Do you feel better now?\" He leaned back still close enough for a kiss and said, \"kiss me.\" I half-smiled and replied, \"Not today.\"\n\n#2: Sexual Fulfillment, You Suck\n\"Chloe\'s sleeping like a baby,\" he said putting his hand on my smooth, naked leg just under my shorts. \"Stop\" I thought, looking at him, moving his hand onto the sheets between us and raising my Nook in front my blue eyes, deep enlarging pupils. \"I\'m not in the mood,\" I answered and went back to reading 50 Shades of Gray.\n\n#3: Conversation, What\'s For Dinner\nWalking through the front door he made known, \"tough day at work,\" accompanied by loud footsteps down the hall and the slam of the door into the garage. The voices of Phineas and Ferb between us, standing behind me and despite my lack of interest, continued, saying, \"anyhow, I lost the blah-blah-blah account,\" shaking his head, \"I need a beer.\" I rested my blonde head on top of juniors, absorbed in his little 8 year old world while distracted by an agitated voice asking from the kitchen, \"what\'s for dinner?\" TSST, a Bud Light Platinum popping open. I looked his way answering, \"whatever, we already ate,\" kissing my son\'s head.\n\n#4: Recreational Companionship, Lake Today?\nMy beautiful body stretched down the slender couch, angelic eyes concealed behind this week\'s People Magazine. \"You didn\'t start the coffee?\" he asked, shirtless and bed-headed. \"No,\" I answered, thinking to myself, \"read between the lines dick-head,\" while listening to the coffee grinder work and kitchen drawers make a musical thudding rhythm. \"Junior and I are going to the lake today, you coming?\" he asked standing at my toes that I just finished painting purple. I put the magazine face-down on my chest and looked at him for a long second, before answering, \"No, I have errands to run today,\" and put People back in front of my angelic eyes, so I didn\'t have to look at him, adding, \"go put a shirt on will you.\"\n\n#5: Honesty and Openness, Sugar Rush\n\"I will try my best,\" I texted then deleted from my phone\'s messages app right before it vibrated again with a new message, \"do you want to meet for lunch?\" fingers paused on the slide out keyboard while I thought for a moment about how to respond back to him and then raced my fingers around the keyboard spelling it out, \"I can\'t. I have to run to Target and buy some candy for junior\'s harvest festival after school today,\" with short clicks ending on Send; fingers typing again, \"William Hughes Park 1pm. I only have a few minutes. M u.\"\n\n#6: Physical Attractiveness, Body & Mind\nI got out off bed and slipped my panties back on and I could feel him watching me. \"What?\" I asked at his naked reflection in the mirror in front of me, hard not to notice his pale gut and foolish look of thinking he doesn\'t have to worry about charming the woman he takes to bed anymore. He took my beauty for granted. I knew it and looked at myself in the same mirror, smiling, knowing another man wants to appreciate every goose bump on my smooth skin that arouses. \"I thought you were coming,\" he said patting his hand on the sheets next to him while I hooked my bra back on. \"No, I\'ve already done that,\" I smiled, rosy cheeks, \"didn\'t you even notice?\" He pulled the sheet up, covering himself, watching me finish getting dressed: gray sweats and a navy blue T-shirt and pull my hair back into pony tail. I turned around and looked at him trying to put how I felt into words: \"you are slightly more pleasurable than my vibrator.\"\n\n#7: Financial Support, Trade Off\nHis laptop screen reflected the Mastercard bill in his glasses, as he asked, \"What did you buy at Ulta?\" \"Perfume,\" I answered while crocheting on the couch. \"And, what in the world did you spend $63.27 on at Victoria\'s Secret?\" he also asked starting to sound pique. I put down my needles and yarn and lifted up my shirt, \"this bra,\" I answered, \"and what I wore to bed last night\". He sighed, lost in in a reflection of his own plight, adding \"You\'ve got to be kidding,\" head shaking at me, \"Cheesecake Factory and Teaz and Pleaz?\", sigh, \"What are you thinking?\" Again, I looked up and answered \"cheesecake and a little fun,\" with a devilish grin, \"do you want play with it too?\". \"No,\" he replied with a short irk, \"When we decided you\'d stay home with junior and quit your job I thought we had an agreement no more spending like we had two incomes. I work hard for this money\" he implored with a cold stare in my direction. Tired of his grumbling I replied \"I\'m going back to work.\" His stare became frustrated and I finished by reminding him it was his turn to do the laundry this weekend.\n\n#8: Domestic Support, Roommates\nThe Saturday morning sun glinted through the half open blinds across an unmade bed. The steam after two showers filled the room a soft, misty fog. \"I thought we would run to Costco and then pack the boat up for winter after lunch,\" he said, still wrapped in a towel, looking for a t-shirt, asking, \"I thought you were going to hang these up yesterday.\" Slipping on my cycling shorts I answered, \"I\'m not your mother.\" He exhaled loudly and mumbled, \"What the hell do you do all day?\" Thinking I didn\'t hear him, but I did and I thought about how I went and left a bag of Reese\'s Pieces on a doorstep, scratched a heart on a wooden bridge in the park and picked up my son. \"I\'m going to the park for a bike ride,\" I said, ignoring his comments, and on the way out of the bedroom, I turned around adding, \"Also, make the bed after putting away your clothes.\" Walking down the hall, I spoke loudly, so I knew he would hear, \"like you did before I said I Do,\" and enjoyed my bike ride through the park.\n\n#9: Admiration, Don\'t Cry Over Spilled Milk\n\"I\'d ask him to go get the milk but he\'d probably find a way to screw it up,\" I typed smiling. \"Who are you texting?\" he asked. \"My boyfriend,\" I snarked without blinking his direction. He looked at me with a growing resent and exhaled a silent \"fuck you\".\n\n#10: Family Commitment, Stand-Off\n\"We need to talk,\" I said sitting on the couch across from him. \"I\'m not happy and staying for junior isn\'t working.\" I took a long breath, wiping a tear from my cheek, hearing him ask \"What\'s wrong?\" I looked at him with my watery eyes and explained, \"It\'s fine, at times, but it\'s missing something still, even after the counseling and the second chance you gave me,\" I blew my nose and looked at him, \"We love each other for junior, not for us.\" He sighed, realizing she was right, thinking \"isn\'t that why we agreed to stay together after your affair\", and asked, \"Okay, now what then?\" A long silence stood between us until I answered, \"one of us leaves.\"\n\n\"Well,\" the counselor said with a short sigh, \"Scott,\" looking at him, \"Christine,\" turning his head to the left at me, \"when you leave today take some time together and talk about those things.\" He smiled at the room and finished up his helpful advice with, \"remember, communication in any relationship is the glue to happiness.\"\n\nI felt my phone vibrate in my purse and took out, \"How r u?\" I read and texted back, \"I didn\'t have the courage to tell him it\'s over.\" It vibrated a few seconds later, \"that\'s what you said last time.\" My fingers swiped across the keyboard in angst, \"I told you to let me handle it.\" Another shake from the phone, \"he\'s never going to leave,\" it read. I swiped back, \"you don\'t know that.\"\n\nScott watched me and asked a little bit annoyed, \"who are you texting?\"\n\n\"The sitter,\" I lied.\n\nI paid the counselor $50 and we left without change.

From the one hour (maybe it was two - in all honesty I got sucked into Words With Friends) Q&A I took away a single comment made by Coyier relating to CodePen\'s CSS that in one weekend, two months later, changed my CSS life forever. \n\nNow, I before the 2014 CSS Dev Conference I had experimented with SASS (using the SCSS syntax) and much like after a blind date I thought it was a pretty and elegant way to handle css. It was creative, smart and with just enough sass and could easily hold an intelligent conversation with my HTML, but once I came down from cloud nine, the ability to create variables and nest styles really wasn\'t worth the investment of effort for me and wasn\'t something I wanted to pursue a long-term relationship with; although, there was that one blonde.  Anyhow, the deal breaker for me was how SASS/SCSS presented the compiled CSS, in specific, media-queries. In a big huff and puff about it at work one day I snubbed my nose and never looked back and returned to coding long-hand using some great shorthand tools like Emmet in Sublime Text.  However as my CSS grew more tentacles with media queries and the files themselves were abstracted for a higher level organization I was starting to realize that this too wasn\'t working and perhaps it was me and not SASS (SCSS).\n\nI typed in Firefox\'s awesome bar: \"Coyier CodePen CSS\" and finally read his mind-blowing blog post about how CodePen leverages SCSS. Now, similar to CodePen I separate my CSS into numerous smaller SCSS files that are easy to manage, semantically readable code, use Autoprefixer (although I use it through Sublime Text) and then through CodeKit I build a single compressed CSS file built from one \"table contents\" SCSS file.  \n\nIt\'s definitely worth a \"pedi-cab!\" ride over to <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://codepen.io/chriscoyier/blog/codepens-css\">Coyier\'s blog post</a> for some great tips on better organizing your CSS life with SCSS.','',381,'2014-12-21 22:26:53','2014-12-21 20:42:37',0,0,0),

Fitbit was prompt in responding to my complaint and replacing my Charge. Kudos to their wonderful customer service. However, the same was true for my Flex after 30 days but at least with the Flex you can purchase new bands. Although, I see a pattern forming.\n\nI haven\'t owned the Vivosmart on enough to evaluate it\'s durability, but I can tell from first impressions this device is much better made and a lot more comfortable to wear. What do I mean about that? The curve in the band and device itself is a more natural fit, where as Fitbit feels more \"squared or flat\" when sitting on top of your wrist. The Vivosmart band is softer and feels more rubber than plastic. Although, I do agree with some of the comments I have read the clasp (which is similar in design to the Fitbit Flex and Charge) doesn\'t feel as secure, but Garmin ships a handy additional clasp which you have to purchase additional from Fitbit or a third party.\n\nWhat I like about the Viviosmart most are the smart notifications. They just work, provide value to wearing a band all the time and as long as you tame your notifications on the iOS side are not overwhelming. For me, the attraction to the Vivosmart is fitness. I can up my game and connect this device to other Garmin products like a heart rate monitor, bike computer or even camera (which I am not sure the benefit of honestly). Where as after being on the Fitbit \"system\" for almost 90 days I feel their goal is not fitness focused, but dialed into a specific goal: weight-loss. Like Fitbit, the Garmin software also (web and mobile) syncs up with MyFitnessPal.Com. In some ways it better uses the MFP data, specifically, with calorie intake and activity based calorie burn. Fitbit for the most part ignores MFP, where Garmin incorporates your activity calorie burn back into your day\'s calorie intake allowance. So if your daily calorie budget is 1,000 and you run for 30 minutes burning 300 calories, Garmin will adjust your day\'s calorie budget to 1,300 to accommodate the burn: smart. Fitbit does not do this.\n\nWhat is your goal? fitness, weight-loss, data-junkie or just think the tech is cool? The Vivosmart is bit more pricey at $170 compared to the Fitbit Charge at $129 and the Flex at $99. Before you drop a penny of that hard earned money take the time to do the research: download the mobile app, read the reviews and forums, make it syncs with other devices you want to integrate, so that you you\'re happy and will most important will be able to reach your goal with the right tech.\n\nBryan and I here at TeaTimeTechTalk, as well as the cool musicians of Weezer who inspired and fueled this quick post \"Wish you a Merry Christmas!\" \n\nEnjoy your new toys!','',725,'2014-12-25 12:14:16','2014-12-25 17:59:14',0,0,0),

It wasn\'t about the fitness band, Regin, at all (or the petite cute blonde in the video), but how the company was out having fun with the Ice Bucket Challenge. After a few more minutes swiping through their timeline I realized this company, from the CEO, http://bit.ly/1Bxv5w3 Judd Armstrong, to the employees dumping buckets of ice water on their heads have a real passion for helping people attain their goals as well as for their bluetooth earbuds and entrance into the fitness band market with the Regin. So far, in the first 48 hours, I haven\'t been wrong.\n\nWhat makes the Jaybird Sport Reign different from every other activity tracker on the crowded shelves of similar product, is that it Reign focuses on aligning your body with your physical activities and uses the biometric data collected from the band to help you attain the level of fitness you strive. It\'s not just something you wear around wrist to count how many steps you have taken and calories burned.  It wants you to forget you\'re wearing it become part of you from the minute you wake up until the moment you fall asleep and then guide you into a healthy tomorrow, challenging your fitness activity.\n\nThe first 48 hours with the Reign have been little off balance. Part of it is me understanding how the Reign\'s philosophy works and breaking my previous \"activity tracker\" thought-behavior which is too judge my progress on count step and calorie burn. The Reign science learns your activities, sleep patterns and monitors your Heart Rate Variability (HRV) http://bit.ly/1D7BW3o so that you know it\'s a great time to challenge yourself or a good day to rest up. Do you ever feel like you\'re getting sick or stressed over a deadline at work? Believe it or not this shows up in your HRV and the Reign uses this data to your fitness advantage. Now, if it just would all work as well as it\'s packaged and advertised.\n\nThe packaging is magniflorious. I haven\'t seen a piece of tech packaged so beautifully since the first iPhone. The cover unfolds, revealing a stunning, master-crafted fitness band that is \"soft and seamless with sand-blasted chrome clips\". It is everything, if not more in-person than how the video http://vimeo.com/107179946 describes. Under the space gray foam the band rest on are all the wonderful accessories, including the charger, two extra silicone straps with clips for sizing, an ankle strap for cycling and two silicone bands without the clips for my best guess is swimming. Also included is a small tool for cleaning the clips. What would have made the packaging better are small icons indicating the usage of each item. For example, a small gray icon of a swimmer under the bands without clasps and maybe a small illustration of the tool and clip to imply cleaning. A minor touch that would have saved me a trip to the online FAQ.\n\nFitting was a snap. Although I was concerned at first because the sizing graph on the back of the box indicated that a small was appropriate for me, where as, other activity trackers I have used (Fitbit Flex & Charge and Garmin Viviosmart) I sized to a large. Jaybird\'s chart was correct and the bands all fit comfortably. I use the tighter one when I worked out this morning because it fits snugger higher up my arm freeing up wrist joint and found the slightly bigger one more comfortable while around the office (or Starbucks in this case) since it fits a touch looser like a watch. \n\nCharging took longer than expected; almost 3 hours and at first didn\'t work. Tech excites me and the Reign was unboxed before my car was even started. The small charge clip was easy to figure it and snap onto the pod. Plug in the micro USB cable to it and the full size USB into my car and I expected some lights to blink to indicate charging, but nothing happened (and yes, I turned on my car to give the USB port power). I jiggled the cable and a red light began to blink. When I got home and moved the charger indoors I had the same problem. The same jiggle fixed it. I am expecting that the soft, flexible USB cable has an internal issue and will eventually bum out on me. After about 3 hours it was completely lit up red with one green light. I assumed it was charged, although I would have expected all the lights to be green; not a show stopper by any means but a touch confusing at first. \n\nNow this is when the Regin started tripping me up. I popped the pod into the band. It snapped in magnetically, but honestly the magnets are not as strong as the video on Jaybird\'s website make them appear. Purely by accident, I dropped it from about 6 inches off the carpet and that was enough to make the pod pop out. Later that night I took off my jacket from a cold evening walk and the band flew out the sleeve. Clearing indicating that while adjusting my sleeve and gloves I inadvertently unclasped the band without knowing. \n\nPairing the Reign pod with my iPhone 6 was just as clumsy. I followed the directions presented in the app, lightly wet the top and bottom of the pod and sat for a few minutes (they state it could take longer than 20 seconds) with the band on my wrist and finger on the cylon eye (lighted strip) to no success. Eventually I checked the online FAQ and removed the pod from the band and tried again. Still no pairing success. A bit frustrated, and reaching the 10 minute point of a simple Bluetooth pairing, I licked the pod and squeezed it with my thumb and index finger probably harder than I should have and bam! 5 seconds later it was paired. When I verified my pairing through the iOS 8 settings I noticed something interesting. My other BT devices: my car and FitBit Charge all had a blue circle \"i\" icon that would allow me to \"forget\" the device but the \"Regin\" did not. Additionally, the Reign would not synch if another Bluetooth device was also connected. Finally paired, and my last task of the night, I went to bed with great anticipation to see how well the Reign auto-detects my sleep and try the Go-Zone for the first time.\n\nThe morning sun peeks between blinds waking me up. I reach over to my phone, tap the Reign app to see what my sleep was like and my disappointment the phone and pod wouldn\'t sync. After restarting the app a few times still no success, I restarted my phone. Eventually the Reign app indicated it \"Band Found\" and synched. Then to my next disappointment no sleep was tracked. I flipped it to the \"Go-Zone\" page where it said \"Try again tomorrow upon waking\" and that I did; only to awake to the same message.\n\nThroughout the day the Regin successfully tracked and labeled my mile walk around Huffaker Hill in Reno, as well did a good job at knowing when I was inactive (or driving or sitting in Starbucks writing this for the past 2 hours). Then, the followin morning it tagged my 7-Minute workout as a \"general activity\" correctly without me having to tell it what type of activity I did. I don\'t expect it to be smart enough to know the difference between Crossfit or Yoga workouts, but the fact it didn\'t type it as a walk, run, ride or swim was great!\n\nClearly there are problems. Problems which after spending $200 just 48 hours ago I should not have at this price point. I have contacted Jaybird support via twitter and they promptly replied asking me to contact their technical support which I have and will continue this review after Jaybird has a chance to address my problems. At this point I am hoping most of my problems are from a defective pod because that will be much faster to remedy, but the tech-gut in me is thinking that the Reign did not have enough testing and was rushed to market.  Hopefully next year, after several app updates, the Reign will be a game changer in the fitness world. Just imagine the possibilities if Jaybird considers partnering with some other fitness focused apps like MapMyFitness, RunKeeper or Livestrong\'s MyPlate and integrate a social user base with challenges and premiere services like personal training, nutrition and dig-deeper stats.\n\nKeep an eye on my Twitter @sjamesmccarthy for an update to this review evaluating Reign\'s app for iOS.\n\nhttp://www.jaybirdsport.com/reign-activity-tracker/','',1492,'2015-01-04 14:18:56','2015-01-04 14:08:57',0,0,0),

Some want it like Dr. Dre,  tweaking the music to emphasize the bass and vocals, while depressing the \"less interesting\" middle frequencies, thus giving it a sharpness to your ear. Others may want their music a little more flat sounding or prefer it be like a \"CD\" and finally you have the \"the way it was recorded at the studio\" crowd. Defining each of those presets is a little subjective in my opinion and going to be a touch crowd to please. So how do all these online music services like Beats, Spotify and Tidal make everyone happy? With their library selection, price, app interfaces and sound quality.\n\nMy first impression with Beats was \"wow, these tunes are crisp, clear and sharp\" compared to Spotify and so I switched services for 30 days wooed over by Beats sound quality. I was curious on why Beats sounded so much better to me. Both Beats and Spotify stream different qualities of the song based on network type, delivery method (mobile app vs. web app) and membership status.  Beats FAQ http://bit.ly/1y0x5Oq reads, \"On the web, we stream in 320kbps MP3 quality audio - industry standard high quality audio for streaming services.  A small minority of tracks may not be available for 320, in which case we\'ll stream in 256kbps.\"  Spotify\'s FAQ http://bit.ly/1ID2ec8 reads, \"We use 3 quality ratings all in Oog Vorbis format. ~96 kbps for normal quality on mobile; ~160 kbps for desktop and web player standard quality. High quality on mobile is ~320 kbps (only available to Premium subscribers) and is considered high quality on desktop and extreme quality on mobile.\" \n\nThat wasn\'t much of a technical difference but the auditory improvements are quite noticeable. Then at Starbucks one day I was becoming frustrated with Spotify\'s flat sound once again, and it hit me: EQ settings. Spotify has no option to adjust the EQ on their desktop clients, either OS X or Windows. Although, this feature was recently added to their iOS mobile app (not sure about Android).  I googled Beats EQ and bam! I found my answer. Beats automatically applies Dr. Dre\'s EQ settings on the tracks streamed, thus giving them, in my opinion, a superior sound quality. \n\nSo how do I make Spotify sound more like Beats? Or just less flat. Adjust your EQ. On my Macbook Air I simply installed Soundflower and Apple\'s Audio Lab. \n \nYou have probably noticed that most of these services are price driven, with Spotify clearly being the winner for family at $9.99 a month +$5 a month additional family members, then recently with Beats lowering it\'s cost to $9.99 month or $99 a year (that\'s basically getting 2 months free) and finally Tidal which brands itself as offering \"high fidelity music\" at a whopping cost of $20 a month. Even with my incredible Jaybird BlueBud X earbuds I don\'t think I could hear a $10 a month difference while running or cycling or sitting in Starbucks, but I also haven\'t tried the service out yet. \n','',536,'2015-01-09 15:35:07','2015-01-11 14:44:21',0,0,0),

I tried it for 45 days and found the curated playlists to be out of date. During the 2014 holidays, Beats was suggesting playlists titled \"Christmas 2012\" and \"Best songs of 2011\". Beats has no radio style feature relying entirely on its community to create relevant playlists of relevant songs. It simply failed me. Spotify on the other hand has radio based on genre or similar to Pandora you can create your own station. In addition, Spotify also has curated playlists and a rather unexplored area of Spotify include apps which give you an interesting interaction with services like last.fm and pitchfork that add value to my music listening experience.\n\nYou have probably noticed that most of these services are price driven, with Spotify clearly being the winner in my opinion for family at $9.99 a month +$5 a month additional family members, then recently with Beats lowering it\'s price to $9.99 month or $99 a year (that\'s basically getting 2 months free) and finally Tidal which brands itself as offering \"high fidelity music\" at a whopping cost of $20 a month. Even with my incredible Jaybird BlueBud X earbuds I don\'t think I could hear a $10 a month difference while running or cycling or sitting in Starbucks, but I also haven\'t tried the service out yet. \n\nOn a last note, choose the music service that fits your listening style.

	(183,112,36,1,1,'Jaybird Reign, First 48 Hours','Surprisingly the tipping point in my choice to throw on the sweats and drive to Best Buy and return my Garmin Vivosmart and pay a little over $200 for this sexy-silicone-band-with-a-brain and oscillating cylon eye was a video that I watched on Twitter @jaybirdsport. It wasn\'t about the Regin at all (or the petite cute blonde in the video), but how the company was out having fun with the Ice Bucket Challenge. After a few more minutes swiping through their timeline I realized this company, from the CEO, Judd Armstrong, to the employees dumping buckets of ice water on their heads have a real passion for helping people attain their goals, as well as for their flagship earbuds which they proudly propped. So far, in the first 48 hours, I haven\'t been wrong: Jaybird is all about \"Power Your Passion\", but can the Reign live up to Jaybird\'s mantra? Lets jump on in and explore.\n\nWhat makes the Jaybird Sport Reign different from every other activity tracker on the crowded shelves of similar product is that it Reign focuses on aligning your body with your physical activities and uses the biometric data collected from the band to help you attain the level of fitness you strive. It\'s not just something you wear around your wrist to count how many steps you have taken and calories burned. As I prepare myself for a Triathlon Sprint I chose the Reign to be my inner-fitness voice. This is perfect, because the Reign wants you to forget you\'re wearing it. It wants to become part of you from the minute you wake up until the moment you fall asleep and then guide you into a healthy tomorrow, challenging your fitness activity and as keep you in as they say, \"the Go-Zone\".\n\nThe first 48 hours with the Reign have been a little off balance. Part of it is me understanding how the Reign\'s philosophy works and breaking my previous \"step tracking\" thought-behavior which is to judge my progress on a count step and calorie burn. Nutrition is a piece of the puzzle Jaybird has yet to even put on the table, so you\'re best options are MyfitnessPal or Livestrong\'s MyPlate (my preference app right now for this data type). The Reign science learns your activities, sleep patterns and monitors your Heart Rate Variability (HRV) http://bit.ly/1D7BW3o so that you know it\'s a great time to challenge yourself or a good day to rest up. Do you ever feel like you\'re getting sick or stressed over a deadline at work? Believe it or not this shows up in your HRV and the Reign uses this data to your fitness advantage. Now, if it just would all work as well as it\'s packaged and advertised, I\'d ride my bike all the way to Utah and kiss that petite blonde in the Ice Bucket Challenge. But Jaybird has some work ahead of itself, but it\'s oh so close.\n\nThe packaging is magniflorious. I haven\'t seen a piece of tech packaged so beautifully since the first iPhone. The cover unfolds, revealing a stunning, master-crafted fitness band that is \"soft and seamless with sand-blasted chrome clips\". It is everything, if not more in-person than how the promotional video http://vimeo.com/107179946 describes. Under the space gray foam the band sits inside are all the wonderful accessories, including the charger, two extra silicone straps with clips for sizing, an ankle strap for cycling and two silicone bands without the clips for swimming. Also included is a small tool for cleaning the clips. What would have made the packaging better are small graphical icons indicating each item would be used. For example, a small gray icon of a swimmer under the bands without clasps and maybe a small illustration of the tool and clip to imply cleaning. A minor touch that would have saved me a trip to the online FAQ.\n\nIMG_0561\n\n \n\nFitting was a snap. Although I was concerned at first because the sizing graph on the back of the box indicated that a small was appropriate for me, where as, other activity trackers I have used (Fitbit Flex & Charge and Garmin Viviosmart) I sized to a large. Jaybird\'s chart was correct and all Reign bands in the small package fit comfortably. I use the tighter one when I worked out this morning because it fits snugger higher up my arm freeing up wrist joint and found the slightly bigger one more comfortable while around the office (or Starbucks in this case) since it fits a touch more loose like a watch.\n\nIMG_0534\n\nCharging took longer than expected; almost 3 hours and at first didn\'t work. Tech excites me and the Reign was unboxed before I left the Best Buy parking lot. The small charge clip was easy to figure out and snap onto the pod. I plugged the micro USB cable into it the charging clip and the other USB end into my car; simple. I expected some lights to blink to indicate charging, but nothing happened (and yes, I turned on my car to give the USB port power). I jiggled the cable and a red light began to blink. When I got home and moved the charger indoors I had the same problem. The same jiggle fixed it. I am expecting that the soft, flexible USB cable has an internal issue and will eventually need replacing. After about 3 hours it was completely lit up red with one green light; I assumed it was charged, although I would have expected all the lights to be green not just one. This confused me a touch but my tech instinct said it was good to go.\n\nNow this is when the Regin started tripping me up. I popped the pod into the band. It snapped in magnetically, but honestly the magnets are not as strong as the video on Jaybird\'s website make them sound. Purely by accident, I dropped it from about 6 inches onto the carpet and that was enough to make the pod pop out. Later that night I took off my jacket from a cold evening walk and the band flew out the sleeve, again, the pod landing on the carpet a few feet away. I suppose while adjusting my sleeve and gloves I inadvertently unclasped the band without feeling it. I expected the magnetic clasp to be much much stronger than it actually appears in the promotional video. The click sound is cool though; reminds me of the magnetic power-clip on my Macbook Air, which is designed for a quick, non-destructive release. So, despite the style is cool on the Reign it may not be a practical solution for a $200 wearable device that you really don\'t want to quickly release.\n\n \n\n \nPairing the Reign pod with my iPhone 6 was just as clumsy. I followed the directions displayed in the app, lightly wet the top and bottom of the pod and sat for a few minutes (they state it could take longer than 20 seconds) with the band on my wrist and finger on the cylon eye (lighted strip) to no success. Eventually I checked the online FAQ and removed the pod from the band and tried again. Still no pairing success. A bit frustrated, and reaching the 10 minute point of a simple Bluetooth pairing, I licked the pod and squeezed it with my thumb and index finger firmly and bam! 5 seconds later it was paired. When I verified my pairing through the iOS 8 settings I noticed something interesting. My other BT devices: my car and FitBit Charge all had a blue circle \"i\" icon that would allow me to \"forget\" the device but the \"Regin\" did not. Additionally, the Reign would not synch if another Bluetooth device was also connected. Finally paired, and my last task of the night, I went to bed with great anticipation to see how well the Reign auto-detected my sleep and to try the Go-Zone for the first time in the morning --goodnight moon.\n\nSeven hours later, the morning sun peeked between blinds waking me up. I took my phone off the nightstand and tapped the Reign app to see what my sleep was like but to my disappointment the phone and pod wouldn\'t sync and no sleep was showing on the app\'s Sleep page. After restarting the app a few times still no success, I restarted my phone. Eventually the Reign app indicated \"Band Found\" and synched, but unfortunately having to quit the app several times. Once the app was done \"synchronizing\" and the \"Processing\" to my next disappointment no sleep was tracked. I flipped it to the \"Go-Zone\" page where it said \"Try again tomorrow upon waking\" and that I did; only to awake to the same message the next morning.\n\n \n\n\n\n \nThroughout both day\'s the Regin successfully tracked and labeled my mile walk around Huffaker Hill in Reno, as well did a good job at knowing when I was inactive (or driving or sitting in Starbucks writing this for the past 2 hours). Then, the following morning it tagged my 7-Minute workout as a \"general activity\" correctly without me having to tell it what type of activity I did. I don\'t expect it to be smart enough to know the difference between Crossfit or Yoga workouts, but the fact it didn\'t type it as a walk, run, ride or swim was great! Later in the day I went for a short 7 mile bike ride and used the included ankle strap for cycling but categorized it as \"sports\" and not \"cycling\". \n\nJust imagine the possibilities if Jaybird considers partnering with some other fitness focused apps like MapMyFitness, Active.Com, RunKeeper or Livestrong\'s MyPlate and integrate a social user base with challenges software based coaching for 5/10ks, marathons, triathlons and more. As of now, the Reign is stuck in the yellow-zone; use with the understanding it has some of rough edges to smooth out.\n\nClearly there are problems, but thank fully most can be addressed with software updates. The current Reign app for iOS is buggy only in the sense in that it won\'t synch properly when you want it to. Eventually there is a data burst and it magically appears accurate. My tech-gut tells me that there is probably an issue with their Bluetooth stack and the pod\'s firmware to communicate with the iPhone. However, at this price point, problems like this should been ironed out before it reached the consumer\'s wrist.\n\nI have contacted Jaybird support via twitter and they promptly -I mean within hours fast- replied asking me to contact their technical support.  After Jaybird has a chance to address my problems I will continue this review. We will see what they can do. Hopefully in the next few weeks and after several app updates, the Reign will be a game changer in the fitness world and help me accomplish my goal of a Sprint Triathlon or riding my bike to Utah ;-)\n\nKeep an eye on my Twitter @sjamesmccarthy for an update to this review deeper look at the Jaybird\'s Reign app.\n\nPros: Great design with unique, new approach at fitness activity trackers!\nCons: Software and pod firmware appear to be a bit buggy.\nUrl: http://www.jaybirdsport.com/reign-activity-tracker/','',1872,'2015-01-04 14:18:56','2015-01-04 17:00:43',0,0,0),

	(185,115,36,1,1,'Jaybird Regin, Last 48 Hours','I had olympic sized expectations for the Jaybird Reign and along my journey with this activity tracker  there were some challenging moments but this is the start of a new journey for Jaybird Sport who is a newcomer in the activity tracker arena -not the fitness world having first released sport performance BlueBud X Bluetooth Earbuds- and is all already a rising star reaching for the gold. Although, the Reign has some great showmanship qualities, during my 10 day evaluation I tested whether the Reign lives up to it\'s own http://bit.ly/1u2doGb expectations and delivers on its mantra of \"knowing when your body wants to be active\". \n\nFrom the start, the Reign received Best of Show awards from http://bit.ly/1xvb7CT Engadget, Slashgear and Outdoor Retailer. It clearly earns these accolades for its smooth silicone band that is sexy, durable, waterproof -not just resistant- and easy to wear design that is functional as well as fashionable. \n\nWooed by its design and unique approach to putting meaning to the data instead of just showing metrics I was ready to ignite that spark already in me and let the Reign guide and encourage me towards my fitness goals.  \n\nLike me, you are probably sold too, especially after watching the videos, but at a $199 MSRP the Reign has to smoke the competition.\n\nAccording to Founder & CEO Judd Armstrong and CMO Rene Oehlerking the Reign has four problems to solve. The first is to eliminate the bulk of the band. Never once did I feel like I was wearing an activity band or device and when positioned just above the wrist joint using a band that fit snug the Reign virtually disappeared, practically becoming an invisible extension of my arm. This made activities from push-ups, burpees and even a simple plank position to writing on a laptop for several hours at a time easy to do and comfortable.  This was a quick win for the Reign over other activity trackers like the Fitbit Flex, Garmin Vivosmart or even Jawbone\'s UP24. It\'s simply the most comfortable activity tracker I have worn.\n\nThe second goal: create a meaningful experience to understanding your daily activity and the meaningful, actionable guidance that you really care about. This is accomplished with the Reign\'s mobile app. Currently, as of time of this review, the app is only available for Apple iOS users. An Android version will be released January 2015. When reviewed, the app delivered on this goal on, but on a high level and without consistency. \n\n(link to first 48 hours) After unboxing the Reign, I charged up the device for about 3 hours and installed the app (version 1.3.3). Once fully charged the Reign pod was ready to pair with my iPhone 6. With the Reign on snug on my wrist, I pressed my index finger on top of the band (where the LEDs display) and tapped the Pair button in the app. The app displayed that this could take up to 20 seconds. I was patient and probably waited about a minute until eventually it failed. I tried again, this time lightly wetting the contact points as suggested and waited. Again it failed. Out of frustration because pairing a device should not be this difficult, I popped the pod out of the band and licked both sides of it, ensuring it was wet as suggested, and held it between my thumb (bottom side) and index finger. Bam! in less than 5 seconds it paired and I was ready to start moving.\n\nEager to test out the Reign\'s ability to auto-detect different activity types the next day I tried a range of activities. Starting out with a http://bit.ly/1DDUGHY 7-Minute Workout. The Reign successfully logged it as \"Sports\" but for only 2 minutes when it was realistically about 10 minutes. Next up was a short run down the American River and again Reign nailed it. It was a little off on the duration, but it detected the activity correctly. Later in the evening I removed the pod from the wrist band and popped it into the ankle band for a bike ride. The ride was 9.91 miles, about 45 minutes of constant peddling. unfortunately the Reign failed to recognize this activity type as \"cycling\". In fact the majority of my day resulted in \"general\" activity. It did good on detecting walking and when I compared the Reign\'s step count to the step count my iPhone 6 reported the two were always within a reasonable to range to each other. \n\nSo how does this translate into meaningful, actionable guidance? Right now it seems like any other activity tracker, but the Reign goes a next step and each activity gets a \"variable activity score\".  I asked their support what that means and really didn\'t get a clear answer.  From what I can tell it is an activity based algorithm that combines exertion and activity into a point system that is used to help set your goals and over time help determine how hard you can push yourself or what activity type you can do to accomplish your daily goal. The problem is the goal itself is emphasized with a point value and then suggested activities that would meet that point value, such as 37 minutes of walking or 16 minutes of running or 22 minutes of cycling. The activity durations make sense to me, the points might as well be something the app just computes without me knowing because it seems like ambiguous data that I don\'t need to know in order to understand my daily activity . It would also make the user experience much simpler.\n\nThe third goal is sleep, and according to CMO Rene Oehlerking, \"simply tracking sleep is weak, but how much sleep do you personally need tonight to be at your best tomorrow \". When I heard this I liked the idea and was excited to see how the Reign app presented my sleep and used the metric to determine a better tomorrow. My first few nights with the Reign sleep tracking was inconsistent. It is suppose to do this automatically. There is no need to press a button for a few seconds to start the function and then do the same in the morning when you awake. However, several nights were not tracked and I had to manually enter the hour when I to bed and the hour I woke up. Unfortunately this misses all the in-between moments of restless sleep, moments of being awake, etc, so how does the Reign know how much sleep I need tonight if it can\'t consistently track it automatically. In the few days it did successfully track my sleep, the recommendation read, \"You are getting great sleep lately and have been exceeding your ideal nightly sleep duration. Keep it up!\" Amazing, but determined mostly on my manually entries. I think there is great potential in this goal but the Reign certainly fell short in comparison other trackers that automatically track sleep like the Fitbit Charge or Garmin\'s Vivosmart.\n\nThe fourth goal is knowing when your body wants to be active or when you need to take a day to recover. This is what Reign refers to as the \"Go-Zone\" and where all this activity recognition and sleep tracking work together, plus one other piece of data that as far as I know other activity trackers don\'t use, which is Heart Rate Variability (HRV), or the variation between heartbeats that are a unique pattern to everyone but can help in sensing fatigue, stress and ...\n\nWhen you wake in the morning, what\'s suppose to happen is your Reign band syncs with the Regin app. In my experience the Reign pod and phone synchronize on the first attempt about 40% of the time. I consistently had to force close the app 3 or 4 times in order to synchronize successfully. Additionally other connected Bluetooth devices would sometimes prevent the pod from synching. This included Jaybird\'s BlueBuds X earbuds in my testing, as well my car\'s bluetooth. When it works, it works great!\n\nOnce the Reign pod synchronizes your nightly data, which must include sleep whether automatically tracked or manually inputed, the Go-Zone will measure your HRV.  Just rest your finger on the LED band for 2 minutes. When the countdown timer gets to zero your Go-Zone number will appear. If you\'re in the range of 40-60 then your body is ready to be active regardless of what you may \"think\". In the two times the GO-Zone worked for me that was absolutely the case. I didn\'t \"feel\" like running one day or cycling the next, but my Go-Zone was 45 the first day and 65 the second and both days I trusted my Go-Zone reading and just did it and wow, what a great workout I had on both occasions that without the Go-Zone push I probably would have ended up being less active.\n\nDespite all the tripping me and the Reign did through our 10 days of being active together, I would like to try this product again once the software has had a few updates and the synchronization process is more stable. The direction Jaybird is moving with the Regin is unlike any other activity tracker in the way it analyzes and uses activity metrics. Professional Runner, Lauren Fleshman, said it best \"The Reign isn\'t just a gadget I wear, it\'s something that I want to use.\"\n\n','',1567,'2015-01-13 11:57:26','2015-01-13 12:39:02',0,0,0),

	(187,115,36,1,1,'Jaybird Regin, Last 48 Hours','I had olympic sized expectations for the Jaybird Reign and along my journey with this activity tracker  there were some challenging moments but this is the start of a new journey for Jaybird Sport who is a newcomer in the activity tracker arena -not the fitness world having first released sport performance BlueBud X Bluetooth Earbuds- and is all already a rising star reaching for the gold. Although, the Reign has some great showmanship qualities, during my 10 day evaluation I tested whether the Reign lives up to it\'s own http://bit.ly/1u2doGb expectations and delivers on its mantra of \"knowing when your body wants to be active\". \n\nFrom the start, the Reign received Best of Show awards from http://bit.ly/1xvb7CT Engadget, Slashgear and Outdoor Retailer. It clearly earns these accolades for its smooth silicone band that is sexy, durable, waterproof -not just resistant- and easy to wear design that is functional as well as fashionable. \n\nWooed by its design and unique approach to putting meaning to the data instead of just showing metrics I was ready to ignite that spark already in me and let the Reign guide and encourage me towards my fitness goals.  \n\nLike me, you are probably sold too, especially after watching the videos, but at a $199 MSRP the Reign has to smoke the competition.\n\nAccording to Founder & CEO Judd Armstrong and CMO Rene Oehlerking the Reign has four problems to solve. The first is to eliminate the bulk of the band. Never once did I feel like I was wearing an activity band or device and when positioned just above the wrist joint using a band that fit snug the Reign virtually disappeared, practically becoming an invisible extension of my arm. This made activities from push-ups, burpees and even a simple plank position to writing on a laptop for several hours at a time easy to do and comfortable.  This was a quick win for the Reign over other activity trackers like the Fitbit Flex, Garmin Vivosmart or even Jawbone\'s UP24. It\'s simply the most comfortable activity tracker I have worn.\n\nThe second goal: create a meaningful experience to understanding your daily activity and the meaningful, actionable guidance that you really care about. This is accomplished with the Reign\'s mobile app. Currently, as of time of this review, the app is only available for Apple iOS users. An Android version will be released January 2015. When reviewed, the app delivered on this goal on, but on a high level and without consistency. \n\n(link to first 48 hours) After unboxing the Reign, I charged up the device for about 3 hours and installed the app (version 1.3.3). Once fully charged the Reign pod was ready to pair with my iPhone 6. With the Reign on snug on my wrist, I pressed my index finger on top of the band (where the LEDs display) and tapped the Pair button in the app. The app displayed that this could take up to 20 seconds. I was patient and probably waited about a minute until eventually it failed. I tried again, this time lightly wetting the contact points as suggested and waited. Again it failed. Out of frustration because pairing a device should not be this difficult, I popped the pod out of the band and licked both sides of it, ensuring it was wet as suggested, and held it between my thumb (bottom side) and index finger. Bam! in less than 5 seconds it paired and I was ready to start moving.\n\nEager to test out the Reign\'s ability to auto-detect different activity types the next day I tried a range of activities. Starting out with a http://bit.ly/1DDUGHY 7-Minute Workout. The Reign successfully logged it as \"Sports\" but for only 2 minutes when it was realistically about 10 minutes. Next up was a short run down the American River and again Reign nailed it. It was a little off on the duration, but it detected the activity correctly. Later in the evening I removed the pod from the wrist band and popped it into the ankle band for a bike ride. The ride was 9.91 miles, about 45 minutes of constant peddling. unfortunately the Reign failed to recognize this activity type as \"cycling\". In fact the majority of my day resulted in \"general\" activity. It did a good on detecting walking and when I compared the Reign\'s step count to the step count my iPhone 6 reported the two were always within a reasonable to range to each other. I did not test swimming.\n\nSo how does this translate into meaningful, actionable guidance? Right now it seems like any other activity tracker, but the Reign goes a next step and each activity gets a \"variable activity score\".  I asked their support what that means and really didn\'t get a clear answer.  From what I can tell it is an activity based algorithm that combines exertion and activity into a point system that is used to help set your goals and over time help determine how hard you can push yourself or what activity type you can do to accomplish your daily goal. The problem is the goal itself is emphasized with a point value and then suggested activities that would meet that point value, such as 37 minutes of walking or 16 minutes of running or 22 minutes of cycling.

It\'s simply the most comfortable activity tracker I have worn.\n\nThe second goal: create a meaningful experience to understanding your daily activity and the meaningful, actionable guidance that you really care about. This is accomplished with the Reign\'s mobile app. Currently, as of time of this review, the app is only available for Apple iOS users. An Android version will be released January 2015. When reviewed, the app delivered on this goal on, but on a high level and without consistency. \n\n(link to first 48 hours) After unboxing the Reign, I charged up the device for about 3 hours and installed the app (version 1.3.3). Once fully charged the Reign pod was ready to pair with my iPhone 6. With the Reign on snug on my wrist, I pressed my index finger on top of the band (where the LEDs display) and tapped the Pair button in the app. The app displayed that this could take up to 20 seconds. I was patient and probably waited about a minute until eventually it failed. I tried again, this time lightly wetting the contact points as suggested and waited. Again it failed. Out of frustration because pairing a device should not be this difficult, I popped the pod out of the band and licked both sides of it, ensuring it was wet as suggested, and held it between my thumb (bottom side) and index finger. Bam! in less than 5 seconds it paired and I was ready to start moving.\n\nEager to test out the Reign\'s ability to auto-detect different activity types the next day I tried a range of activities. Starting out with a http://bit.ly/1DDUGHY 7-Minute Workout. The Reign successfully logged it as \"Sports\" but for only 2 minutes when it was realistically about 10 minutes. Next up was a short run down the American River and again Reign nailed it. It was a little off on the duration, but it detected the activity correctly. Later in the evening I removed the pod from the wrist band and popped it into the ankle band for a bike ride. The ride was 9.91 miles, about 45 minutes of constant peddling. unfortunately the Reign failed to recognize this activity type as \"cycling\". In fact the majority of my day resulted in \"general\" activity. It did a good on detecting walking and when I compared the Reign\'s step count to the step count my iPhone 6 reported the two were always within a reasonable to range to each other. I did not test swimming.\n\nSo how does this translate into meaningful, actionable guidance? Right now it seems like any other activity tracker, but the Reign goes a next step and each activity gets a \"variable activity score\".  I asked their support what that means and really didn\'t get a clear answer.  From what I can tell it is an activity based algorithm that combines exertion and activity into a point system that is used to help set your goals and over time help determine how hard you can push yourself or what activity type you can do to accomplish your daily goal. The problem is the goal itself is emphasized with a point value and then suggested activities that would meet that point value, such as 37 minutes of walking or 16 minutes of running or 22 minutes of cycling. The activity durations make sense to me, the points might as well be something the app just computes without me knowing because it seems like ambiguous data that I don\'t need to know in order to understand my daily activity . It would also make the user experience much simpler.\n\nThe third goal is sleep, and according to CMO Rene Oehlerking, \"simply tracking sleep is weak, but how much sleep do you personally need tonight to be at your best tomorrow \". When I heard this I liked the idea and was excited to see how the Reign app presented my sleep and used the metric to determine a better tomorrow. My first few nights with the Reign sleep tracking was inconsistent. It is suppose to do this automatically. There is no need to press a button for a few seconds to start the function and then do the same in the morning when you awake. However, several nights were not tracked and I had to manually enter the hour when I to bed and the hour I woke up. Unfortunately this misses all the in-between moments of restless sleep, moments of being awake, etc, so how does the Reign know how much sleep I need tonight if it can\'t consistently track it automatically. In the few days it did successfully track my sleep, the recommendation read, \"You are getting great sleep lately and have been exceeding your ideal nightly sleep duration. Keep it up!\" Amazing, but determined mostly on my manually entries. I think there is great potential in this goal but the Reign certainly fell short in comparison other trackers that automatically track sleep like the Fitbit Charge or Garmin\'s Vivosmart. It also does not have silent, vibrating alarms.\n\nThe fourth goal is knowing when your body wants to be active or when you need to take a day to recover. This is what Reign refers to as the \"Go-Zone\" and where all this activity recognition and sleep tracking work together, plus one other piece of data that as far as I know other activity trackers don\'t use, which is Heart Rate Variability (HRV), or the milliseconds between your heartbeats that are a unique pattern to everyone but can help in sensing fatigue, stress and ...\n\nWhen you wake in the morning, what\'s suppose to happen is your Reign pod (firmware version 3.5.2) syncs with the Regin app. In my experience the Reign pod and phone synchronize successfully on the first attempt about 40% of the time. I consistently had to force close the app 3 or 4 times in order to synchronize. Additionally other connected Bluetooth devices would sometimes prevent the pod from synching. This included Jaybird\'s BlueBuds X earbuds in my testing, as well my car\'s bluetooth. When it works, it works great!\n\nOnce the Reign pod synchronizes your nightly data, which must include sleep whether automatically tracked or manually inputed, the Go-Zone will measure your HRV.  Just rest your finger on the LED band for 2 minutes. When the countdown timer gets to zero your Go-Zone number will appear. If you\'re in the range of 40-60 then your body is ready to be active regardless of what you may \"think\". In the two times the GO-Zone worked for me that was absolutely the case. I didn\'t \"feel\" like running one day or cycling the next, but my Go-Zone was 45 the first day and 65 the second and both days I trusted my Go-Zone reading and just did it and wow, what a great workout I had on both occasions that without the Go-Zone push I probably would have ended up being less active.\n\nDespite all the tripping the Reign and I did through our 10 days of being active together, I would like to try this product again once the software has had a few updates and the synchronization process is more stable. The direction Jaybird is moving with the Regin is unlike any other activity tracker in how it analyzes and uses activity metrics to help you achieve the most activity out of your day, even when you don\'t think you can.

	(191,115,36,1,1,'Jaybird Regin, Last 48 Hours','When I walked out of Best Buy after purchasing the Jaybird Reign I had big expectations for this sleek looking silicone band; available in black and white. Wooed by its design and fresh thinking for activity trackers, which is to give meaning to your steps, activity and heart information above just showing a metric on a pretty graph, I was ready to join this team and go beyond counting my steps and calories burned.  I was pumped to run, swim and bike!\n\nJaybird raced into the fitness world with their  remarkable sounding and highly acclaimed http://bit.ly/1y99BFA Bluebuds X Bluetooth Headphones and the new family member, Reign,  has the same great showmanship qualities and thought-though innovative design. During my 10 day evaluation I tested whether the Reign lives up to creator\'s vision http://bit.ly/1u2doGb and mantra of \"knowing when your body wants to be active\". \n\nFrom the start, the Reign received Best of Show awards from http://bit.ly/1xvb7CT Engadget, Slashgear and Outdoor Retailer. It clearly earns these accolades for its smooth silicone band that is sexy, durable, waterproof -not just resistant- and most comfortable to wear design that is functional as well as fashionable. \n\nLike me, you are probably sold too, especially after watching the videos on the Reign website, but in a tight race of other activity trackers where price point is crucial,  the Reign has to smoke the competition at $199 MSRP ($217 total with tax for me, which is a lot of money for an activity tracker but comparable -on the high side- in it\'s category which includes heart monitoring and usually some small notification features).\n\nAccording to Founder & CEO Judd Armstrong and CMO Rene Oehlerking the Reign has four problems to solve. The Reign\'s solutions to these four problems make it different from it\'s competition and in many ways better. But like any newly innovated product or idea, it comes with some hiccups and hurdles.\n\nThe first challenge was to eliminate the bulk of the band. Never once did I feel like I was wearing an activity band or device and when positioned just above the wrist joint using a band that fit snug the Reign virtually disappeared, practically becoming an invisible extension of my arm. This made activities from push-ups, burpees and even a simple plank position to writing on a laptop for several hours at a time easy to do and comfortable.  This was a quick win for the Reign over other activity trackers like the Fitbit Flex, Garmin Vivosmart or even Jawbone\'s UP24. It\'s simply the most comfortable activity tracker I have worn. I never thought about taking it off and honestly didn\'t want to. I loved how it felt both physically on my wrist and how it made me feel mentally; visual encouragement.\n\nThe second goal was to create an understanding your daily activity and the meaningful, actionable guidance that you really care about. It\'s not a tracker designed to simply count steps, activities and burned calories. This is done through the Reign\'s mobile app. Currently, as of time of this review, the app is only available for Apple iOS users. Android version will be released January 2015, but as of the 15th it\'s still not appearing in the Google Play Marketplace. The iOS app for the most part delivered on this goal on, but only a high level, without consistency and it\'s important to know that your data is currently, as of version 1.3.3, is only stored on your phone and if for some reason you re-pair or logout of your Reign account the data will erased.\n\nThe first major missing part of the current app is a history. You can only view information for the current day. This means that you have no way of looking back and seeing how you slept the day before or yesterday\'s Go-Zone score or even look at this data over any period of time for comparison which could be valuable in analyzing trends. There is also no web-based site you log into for deeper metrics nor is your data currently sent to Jaybird. \n\nNot to worry though, according to update schedule on Jaybird\'s website for the Reign these fixes are underway and planned for this coming January and February 2015. In fact there is some pretty cool features underway like backup to the Regin Cloud, notifications and alerts and access to you activity history. Something Jaybird might consider is a more aggressive update schedule, perhaps every 2 weeks, to attack some of the low-hanging and crucial bugs as well provide an early look at upcoming features and maybe add iCloud support. That small enhancement would have saved my random data loss problem.\n\n(link to first 48 hours review) After unboxing the Reign, I charged up the device for about 3 hours, which was about an hour longer than the directions read. Once fully charged the Reign pod was ready to pair with my iPhone 6. With the Reign on snug on my wrist, I pressed my index finger on top of the band (where the LEDs display) and tapped the pair button in the app. The app displayed that this could take up to 20 seconds. I was patient and probably waited about a minute until eventually it failed. I tried again, this time lightly wetting the contact points as suggested and waited. Again it failed. Out of frustration because pairing a device should not be this difficult, I popped the pod out of the band and licked both sides of it, ensuring it was wet as suggested, and held it between my thumb (bottom side) and index finger.

It did a good on detecting walking and when I compared the Reign\'s step count to the step count my iPhone 6 reported the two were always within a reasonable to range to each other. I did not test swimming; the lake is too cold right now, but am excited to try it in the spring and maybe with a new Reign with a more robust app.\n\nSo how does this translate into meaningful, actionable guidance? Right now it seems like any other activity tracker, but the Reign goes a next step and each activity gets a \"variable activity score\".  I asked their support what that means and really didn\'t get a clear answer. Although support was extremely responsive as well as interested in my challenges with the device and software. So, from what I surmise is that it is an activity based algorithm that combines exertion and activity into a point system that is used to help set your goals and over time help determine how hard you can push yourself or what activity type you can do to accomplish your daily goal. The goal itself is emphasized with a point value and then suggested activities that would meet that point value. This is okay I suppose but confusing. Why have the points displayed at all? For example, I can ear my 1,609 points with 37 minutes of walking or 16 minutes of running or 22 minutes of cycling. The activity durations make sense to me, the points might as well be something the app just computes without me knowing because it seems like ambiguous data that I don\'t need to know in order to understand and accomplish my daily activity. Metrics are fun to look at though, I guess.\n\nThe third goal is sleep, and according to CMO Rene Oehlerking, \"simply tracking sleep is weak, but how much sleep do you personally need tonight to be at your best tomorrow \". When I heard this I liked the idea and was excited to see how the Reign app presented my sleep and used the metric to determine a better tomorrow.

In fact, several nights were not tracked and I had to manually enter the hour when I to bed and the hour I woke up. Unfortunately I think this misses all the in-between moments of restless sleep, deep sleep, moments of being awake, etc, so how does the Reign know how much sleep I need tonight if it can\'t consistently track it automatically. And, no where in the app I could find suggestions on when to go to bed based on previous sleep/wake times. In the few days it did successfully track my sleep, the recommendation read, \"You are getting great sleep lately and have been exceeding your ideal nightly sleep duration. Keep it up!\" Amazing, but determined mostly on my manually entries. I think there is great potential in this feature but the Reign certainly fell short in comparison other trackers that automatically track sleep like the Fitbit Charge or Garmin\'s Vivosmart. It also does not have silent, vibrating alarms, which once you start using you will never go back to waking to beeps or radio again.\n\nThe fourth goal is knowing when your body wants to be active or when you need to take a day to recover. This is what Jaybird calls the \"Go-Zone\" and where all this activity recognition and sleep tracking work together, plus one other piece of data that as far as I know other activity trackers don\'t use, which is http://bit.ly/1syWrCn Heart Rate Variability (HRV), or the milliseconds between your heartbeats that can indicate fatigue, stress or in the Reign\'s case, over training.\n\nWhen you wake in the morning, what\'s suppose to happen is your Reign pod (firmware version 3.5.2) syncs with the Regin app of the first time. Unfortunately, in my experience the Reign pod and phone synchronize successfully on the first attempt about 40% of the time. I consistently had to force close the app 3 or 4 times in order to synchronize. Additionally other connected Bluetooth devices would sometimes prevent the pod from synching. This included Jaybird\'s BlueBuds X headphones in my testing, as well my Subaru\'s bluetooth system. \n\nOnce the Reign pod synchronizes your nightly data, which must include sleep whether automatically tracked or manually inputed, the Go-Zone will measure your HRV by resting your finger on the LED band for 2 minutes. When the countdown timer gets to zero your Go-Zone number will appear. If you\'re in the range of 40-60 then your body is ready to be active regardless of what you may \"think\". In the two times that the GO-Zone worked for me it was right on the money. Although I didn\'t \"feel\" like running one day or cycling the next, my Go-Zone was 45 the first day and 65 the second and both days I trusted my Go-Zone reading and just did it and wow, what a great workout I had on both occasions that without the Go-Zone push I probably would have ended up being less active.\n\nDespite all the tripping the Reign and I did through our 10 days of being active together, I would like to try this product again once the software has had a few updates and the synchronization process is more stable. The direction Jaybird is moving with the Regin is unlike any other activity tracker in how it analyzes activity metrics to help you achieve the most activity out of your day, even when you don\'t think you can. \n\nI really like this product and found the majority of my problems with the software. The band is five-star awesome! I will definitely be coming back to the Reign family once I see the reviews on the app store and at Amazon start rising up to where they should be, but Jaybird will not get there anytime soon without healing their app\'s injuries and getting it on more frequent update schedule to earn back consumer\'s trust.','',2098,'2015-01-13 11:57:26','2015-01-14 11:25:15',0,1,0),

He passed her an inconspicuous glance indicating his disinterest in silence and lack of presence. She smiled with a cute, \"I\'m sorry,\" but all she saw was his email reflected in his glasses. She felt a ponderous sadness pass through her walking down the hall to the bedroom.\n\nThe nightstand lamp dimly lit the room. Above the short, but long bookcase, a tv was mounted on the wall, her jewelry box and a silver necklace laid on the surface along with a family photo from last November. They all wore matching blue jeans and white t-shirts and posed against country style wooden fence, the ground sprinkled by autumn colors. Their smiles hid the exhaustive argument that had on the way to the park. A circular votive candle holder hung over the bed but never used. The bed was made, as she always made it after they showered in the morning, and a small chair sat in each corner of the bedroom with her night shirt flung over one of them and his sweat pants on the other. Slippers tucked underneath. \n\nUndressing from the day, she pulled the night shirt over her heard and kneeled beside the bed pulling out an old shoe box that had a large orange sales sticker on it. She took out a small brown leather journal then pushed the box back where she kept it hidden from everyone; sometimes even herself.\n\nTossing the sheets aside, she laid down and opened the journal.\n\nAugust 14, 2009\n\"Okay, you can give me a hug,\" she said to me, looking at me warmly with eyes smiling from the inside out and a voice that I knew. Our hearts beat against each other. I didnâ€™t want to let go as our hearts made out like love-crazy teenagers, and stood there in the middle of the Subway parking lot captivated by one another until our arms fell to their sides holding hands. I glanced down and saw our fingers interlocked in a sweet yet complicated reunion, then back into her blue eyes where I am forever found. The tan line on her finger explained what she wouldn\'t tell me until I drove 1,374 miles to see her. It was too already too late because it didn\'t matter to either one of us. We had already fallen in love with no more than a hug and touch of the hand, and I knew that I wanted was to take her with me into the rest of my life. On the drive back to California she texted, \"I want to feel you inside me.\" A tease that lead to the most enjoyable drive through the Great Salt Lake. #end\n\nRemember the sexting of that day, her cheeks blushed the color of her lipstick which she hadn\'t taken off yet, bite the corner of her lower lip, touching herself in a way she also remembered him touching her on that midnight rendezvous outside the movie theater and then again in the hotel room a month later.\n\nShe turned the page, moistening her fingers and sliding them under her shorts and kept reading. The soft brush of her wet finger feeling her sensitive skin. A tickle sensation flowed through her body while she massaged herself slowly with one hand, turning pages of the journal with the other. \n\nA soft moan as her finger moved slightly faster, a light tingling sensation building as fingers became wetter and dipped into her discovering a warm, sticky pleasure. \n\nShe turned the next page.\n\nSeptember 15, 2009.\nI can\'t explain how wonderful today was. After another really long 17 hour, stop for gas and pee-break only drive she stood in front me with those angelic eyes and immediately grabbed my lips with hers. \"Do you have any music?\" she asked me. I opened the laptop on the nightstand next to me and put on the playlist she made for me: Keep Me In Your Thoughts by Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers filled the room. She stood at the foot of the bed, shoulder length blonde hair looking me in nothing but her blue panties and matching bra and seductive \"come and get me\" smile. My eyes lusting up and down her petite body as it crawled on top of me taking my lips into her mouth. She held me, hard, moving her hand, while my erection grew longer and my hand slipped under her panties feeling the warm, wet, sticky pleasure of her sex, finger sinking slowly inside her fire. She moaned and rocked her hips a few times then spun on top of me, grinding her warm, moist sex against my balls. Her boobs looked down at me filling her bra and wiggling to pop out into my hands. She rubbed down against me harder letting the tip slide inside her, slippery and warm. After a few pokes I pushed inside her, then back slowly, starting a rhythm: up and down, back and forth. She gyrated her hips whispering, \"I love how you feel inside me,\" as the sensation spread, swinging her hips back into me again. I felt the tip touch a soft pillow. It was warm, tingling, erotic. I held it there feeling the inside of wet and happy flower suck the tip the of my penis, tight, warm and hot. She squeezed her legs into my side and moaned, \"I want to feel you cum inside me,\" and I rolled on top of her. I unsnapped her bra. She wiggled it off her arms my hand cupping her squishy boobs, my thumbs circling her nipples; our mouths open and tongues tango.  We start the pattern again: left to right and up and down, and down again and slowly in and out. A sensuous tempo. The pleasure desiring to release tickled by a growing sensation from my toes to my finger tips which firmly sat on her belly, balancing me as I moved inside her somewhere in between slow and then deep and faster and then slower until her finger nails lightly ran down my shoulders and sides of my back while her soul was massaged by an exhaustive orgasm. I was about to cum and pushed deep inside her until I felt that soft, warm pillow of love surrounded by our warm release. My lips buried in her neck, feeling completely vulnerable yet totally satisfied.  She whispered, \"I love you\". #end\n\nShe slipped her hand out from under panties back over her belly and between her breasts with a self-satisfied sigh. His silhouette stood in the door watching her.\n\n\"What are you reading?\" he asked with a curiosity and stretched himself out on the bed beside her. His hand rested on top of her bare, naked leg stroking its smoothness along the inside of her thigh. She was wet and aroused from the story, sensitive to his touch. She shivered and took a long breath before returning him a seductive smile and closed the pages of the brown journal. \n\nLicking her fingers she reached through his boxers, rubbing his dick hard while circling her tongue with his and then along his lips in a long passionate kiss. His hand rushed over her belly button under her shirt grabbing her breasts, squeezing them and then down again between her legs tugging her panties from around her knees. She slid her back down the pillow flipping him and he dropped on top of her; his boxers tugged off with her feet and she opened her legs on each side of him. He easily fell inside her wet sensuous pleasure.\n\nShe moaned quietly to herself staring at the ceiling while he rocked in and out; wet, smooth, warm and fast. She put her hand on his shoulder escaping back into the memories, the words she just read while waiting for him to finish.

My lips buried in her neck, feeling completely vulnerable yet totally satisfied.  She whispered, \"I love you\". #end\n\nShe slipped her hand out from under panties back over her belly and between her breasts with a self-satisfied sigh. His silhouette stood in the door watching her.\n\n\"What are you reading?\" he asked with a curiosity and stretched himself out on the bed beside her. His hand rested on top of her bare, naked leg stroking its smoothness along the inside of her thigh. She was wet and aroused from the story, sensitive to his touch. She shivered and took a long breath before returning him a seductive smile and closed the pages of the brown journal. \n\nLicking her fingers she reached through his boxers, rubbing his dick hard while circling her tongue with his and then along his lips in a long passionate kiss. His hand rushed over her belly button under her shirt grabbing her breasts, squeezing them and then down again between her legs tugging her panties from around her knees. She slid her back down the pillow flipping him and he dropped on top of her; his boxers tugged off with her feet and she opened her legs on each side of him. He easily fell inside her wet sensuous pleasure.\n\nShe moaned quietly to herself staring at the ceiling while he rocked in and out; wet, smooth, warm and fast. She put her hand on his shoulder escaping back into the memories, the words she just read while waiting for him to finish.

	(232,115,36,1,1,'10 Days With My Jaybird Reign Activity Tracker','When I walked out of Best Buy after purchasing the Jaybird Reign I had big expectations for this sleek looking silicone band; available in black and white. Wooed by its design and fresh thinking for activity trackers, which is to give meaning to your steps, activity and heart information above just showing a metric on a pretty graph, I was ready to join this team and go beyond counting my steps and calories burned.  I was pumped to run, swim and bike!\n\nJaybird raced into the fitness world with their  remarkable sounding and highly acclaimed http://bit.ly/1y99BFA Bluebuds X Bluetooth Headphones and the new family member, Reign,  has the same great showmanship qualities and thought-though innovative design. During my 10 day evaluation I tested whether the Reign lives up to creator\'s vision http://bit.ly/1u2doGb and mantra of \"knowing when your body wants to be active\". \n\nFrom the start, the Reign received Best of Show awards from http://bit.ly/1xvb7CT Engadget, Slashgear and Outdoor Retailer. It clearly earns these accolades for its smooth silicone band that is sexy, durable, waterproof -not just resistant- and most comfortable to wear design that is functional as well as fashionable. \n\nLike me, you are probably sold too, especially after watching the videos on the Reign website, but in a tight race of other activity trackers where price point is crucial,  the Reign has to smoke the competition at $199 MSRP ($217 total with tax for me, which is a lot of money for an activity tracker but comparable -on the high side- in it\'s category which includes heart monitoring and usually some small notification features).\n\nAccording to Founder & CEO Judd Armstrong and CMO Rene Oehlerking the Reign has four problems to solve. The Reign\'s solutions to these four problems make it different from it\'s competition and in many ways better. But like any newly innovated product or idea, it comes with some hiccups and hurdles.\n\nThe first challenge was to eliminate the bulk of the band. Never once did I feel like I was wearing an activity band or device and when positioned just above the wrist joint using a band that fit snug the Reign virtually disappeared, practically becoming an invisible extension of my arm. This made activities from push-ups, burpees and even a simple plank position to writing on a laptop for several hours at a time easy to do and comfortable.  This was a quick win for the Reign over other activity trackers like the Fitbit Flex, Garmin Vivosmart or even Jawbone\'s UP24. It\'s simply the most comfortable activity tracker I have worn. I never thought about taking it off and honestly didn\'t want to. I loved how it felt both physically on my wrist and how it made me feel mentally; visual encouragement.\n\nThe second goal was to create an understanding your daily activity and the meaningful, actionable guidance that you really care about. It\'s not a tracker designed to simply count steps, activities and burned calories. This is done through the Reign\'s mobile app. Currently, as of time of this review, the app is only available for Apple iOS users. Android version will be released January 2015, but as of the 15th it\'s still not appearing in the Google Play Marketplace. The iOS app for the most part delivered on this goal on, but only a high level, without consistency and it\'s important to know that your data is currently, as of version 1.3.3, is only stored on your phone and if for some reason you re-pair or logout of your Reign account the data will erased.\n\nThe first major missing part of the current app is a history. You can only view information for the current day. This means that you have no way of looking back and seeing how you slept the day before or yesterday\'s Go-Zone score or even look at this data over any period of time for comparison which could be valuable in analyzing trends. There is also no web-based site you log into for deeper metrics nor is your data currently sent to Jaybird. \n\nNot to worry though, according to update schedule on Jaybird\'s website for the Reign these fixes are underway and planned for this coming January and February 2015. In fact there is some pretty cool features underway like backup to the Regin Cloud, notifications and alerts and access to you activity history. Something Jaybird might consider is a more aggressive update schedule, perhaps every 2 weeks, to attack some of the low-hanging and crucial bugs as well provide an early look at upcoming features and maybe add iCloud support. That small enhancement would have saved my random data loss problem.\n\n(link to first 48 hours review) After unboxing the Reign, I charged up the device for about 3 hours, which was about an hour longer than the directions read. Once fully charged the Reign pod was ready to pair with my iPhone 6. With the Reign on snug on my wrist, I pressed my index finger on top of the band (where the LEDs display) and tapped the pair button in the app. The app displayed that this could take up to 20 seconds. I was patient and probably waited about a minute until eventually it failed. I tried again, this time lightly wetting the contact points as suggested and waited. Again it failed. Out of frustration because pairing a device should not be this difficult, I popped the pod out of the band and licked both sides of it, ensuring it was wet as suggested, and held it between my thumb (bottom side) and index finger. Bam! in less than 5 seconds it paired and I was ready to start moving.\n\nEager to test out the Reign\'s ability to auto-detect different activity types the next day I tried a range of activities. Starting out with a http://bit.ly/1DDUGHY 7-Minute Workout. The Reign successfully logged it as \"Sports\" but for only 2 minutes when it was realistically about 10 minutes. Next up was a short run down the American River and again Reign nailed it. It was a little off on the duration, but it detected the activity correctly. Later in the evening I removed the pod from the wrist band and popped it into the ankle band for a bike ride. The ride was 9.91 miles, about 45 minutes of constant peddling. Unfortunately the Reign failed to recognize this activity type as \"cycling\". In fact the majority of my day resulted in \"general\" activity. It did a good on detecting walking and when I compared the Reign\'s step count to the step count my iPhone 6 reported the two were always within a reasonable to range to each other. I did not test swimming; the lake is too cold right now, but am excited to try it in the spring and maybe with a new Reign with a more robust app.\n\nSo how does this translate into meaningful, actionable guidance? Right now it seems like any other activity tracker, but the Reign goes a next step and each activity gets a \"variable activity score\".  I asked their support what that means and really didn\'t get a clear answer. Although support was extremely responsive as well as interested in my challenges with the device and software. So, from what I surmise is that it is an activity based algorithm that combines exertion and activity into a point system that is used to help set your goals and over time help determine how hard you can push yourself or what activity type you can do to accomplish your daily goal. The goal itself is emphasized with a point value and then suggested activities that would meet that point value. This is okay I suppose but confusing. Why have the points displayed at all? For example, I can ear my 1,609 points with 37 minutes of walking or 16 minutes of running or 22 minutes of cycling. The activity durations make sense to me, the points might as well be something the app just computes without me knowing because it seems like ambiguous data that I don\'t need to know in order to understand and accomplish my daily activity. Metrics are fun to look at though, I guess.\n\nThe third goal is sleep, and according to CMO Rene Oehlerking, \"simply tracking sleep is weak, but how much sleep do you personally need tonight to be at your best tomorrow \". When I heard this I liked the idea and was excited to see how the Reign app presented my sleep and used the metric to determine a better tomorrow. However, my first few nights with the Reign sleep tracking were inconsistent and the automatic sleep detection didn\'t work. In fact, several nights were not tracked and I had to manually enter the hour when I to bed and the hour I woke up. Unfortunately I think this misses all the in-between moments of restless sleep, deep sleep, moments of being awake, etc, so how does the Reign know how much sleep I need tonight if it can\'t consistently track it automatically. And, no where in the app I could find suggestions on when to go to bed based on previous sleep/wake times. In the few days it did successfully track my sleep, the recommendation read, \"You are getting great sleep lately and have been exceeding your ideal nightly sleep duration. Keep it up!\" Amazing, but determined mostly on my manually entries. I think there is great potential in this feature but the Reign certainly fell short in comparison other trackers that automatically track sleep like the Fitbit Charge or Garmin\'s Vivosmart. It also does not have silent, vibrating alarms, which once you start using you will never go back to waking to beeps or radio again.\n\nThe fourth goal is knowing when your body wants to be active or when you need to take a day to recover. This is what Jaybird calls the \"Go-Zone\" and where all this activity recognition and sleep tracking work together, plus one other piece of data that as far as I know other activity trackers don\'t use, which is http://bit.ly/1syWrCn Heart Rate Variability (HRV), or the milliseconds between your heartbeats that can indicate fatigue, stress or in the Reign\'s case, over training.\n\nWhen you wake in the morning, what\'s suppose to happen is your Reign pod (firmware version 3.5.2) syncs with the Regin app of the first time. Unfortunately, in my experience the Reign pod and phone synchronize successfully on the first attempt about 40% of the time. I consistently had to force close the app 3 or 4 times in order to synchronize. Additionally other connected Bluetooth devices would sometimes prevent the pod from synching. This included Jaybird\'s BlueBuds X headphones in my testing, as well my Subaru\'s bluetooth system. \n\nOnce the Reign pod synchronizes your nightly data, which must include sleep whether automatically tracked or manually inputed, the Go-Zone will measure your HRV by resting your finger on the LED band for 2 minutes. When the countdown timer gets to zero your Go-Zone number will appear. If you\'re in the range of 40-60 then your body is ready to be active regardless of what you may \"think\". In the two times that the GO-Zone worked for me it was right on the money. Although I didn\'t \"feel\" like running one day or cycling the next, my Go-Zone was 45 the first day and 65 the second and both days I trusted my Go-Zone reading and just did it and wow, what a great workout I had on both occasions that without the Go-Zone push I probably would have ended up being less active.\n\nDespite all the tripping the Reign and I did through our 10 days of being active together, I would like to try this product again once the software has had a few updates and the synchronization process is more stable. The direction Jaybird is moving with the Regin is unlike any other activity tracker in how it analyzes activity metrics to help you achieve the most activity out of your day, even when you don\'t think you can. \n\nI really like this product and found the majority of my problems with the software. The band is five-star awesome! I will definitely be coming back to the Reign family once I see the reviews on the app store and at Amazon start rising up to where they should be, but Jaybird will not get there anytime soon without healing their app\'s injuries and getting it on more frequent update schedule to earn back consumer\'s trust.','',2098,'2015-01-13 11:57:26','2015-01-14 14:26:31',0,0,0),

	(241,115,36,1,1,'10 Days With My Jaybird Reign Activity Tracker','When I walked out of Best Buy after purchasing the Jaybird Reign I had big expectations for this sleek looking silicone band; available in black and white. Wooed by its design and fresh thinking for activity trackers, which is to give meaning to your steps, activity and heart information above just showing a metric on a pretty graph, I was ready to join this team and go beyond counting my steps and calories burned.  I was pumped to run, swim and bike!\n\nJaybird raced into the fitness world with their  remarkable sounding and highly acclaimed http://bit.ly/1y99BFA Bluebuds X Bluetooth Headphones and the new family member, Reign,  has the same great showmanship qualities and thought-though innovative design. During my 10 day evaluation I tested whether the Reign lives up to creator\'s vision http://bit.ly/1u2doGb and mantra of \"knowing when your body wants to be active\". \n\nFrom the start, the Reign received Best of Show awards from http://bit.ly/1xvb7CT Engadget, Slashgear and Outdoor Retailer. It clearly earns these accolades for its smooth silicone band that is sexy, durable, waterproof -not just resistant- and most comfortable to wear design that is functional as well as fashionable. \n\nLike me, you are probably sold too, especially after watching the videos on the Reign website, but in a tight race of other activity trackers where price point is crucial,  the Reign has to smoke the competition at $199 MSRP ($217 total with tax for me, which is a lot of money for an activity tracker but comparable -on the high side- in it\'s category which includes heart monitoring and usually some small notification features).\n\nAccording to Founder & CEO Judd Armstrong and CMO Rene Oehlerking the Reign has four problems to solve. The Reign\'s solutions to these four problems make it different from it\'s competition and in many ways better. But like any newly innovated product or idea, it comes with some hiccups and hurdles.\n\nThe first challenge was to eliminate the bulk of the band. Never once did I feel like I was wearing an activity band or device and when positioned just above the wrist joint using a band that fit snug the Reign virtually disappeared, practically becoming an invisible extension of my arm. This made activities from push-ups, burpees and even a simple plank position to writing on a laptop for several hours at a time easy to do and comfortable.  This was a quick win for the Reign over other activity trackers like the Fitbit Flex, Garmin Vivosmart or even Jawbone\'s UP24. It\'s simply the most comfortable activity tracker I have worn. I never thought about taking it off and honestly didn\'t want to. I loved how it felt both physically on my wrist and how it made me feel mentally; visual encouragement.\n\nThe second goal was to create an understanding your daily activity and the meaningful, actionable guidance that you really care about. It\'s not a tracker designed to simply count steps, activities and burned calories. This is done through the Reign\'s mobile app. Currently, as of time of this review, the app is only available for Apple iOS users. Android version will be released January 2015, but as of the 15th it\'s still not appearing in the Google Play Marketplace. The iOS app for the most part delivered on this goal on, but only a high level, without consistency and it\'s important to know that your data is currently, as of version 1.3.3, is only stored on your phone and if for some reason you re-pair or logout of your Reign account the data will erased.\n\nThe first major missing part of the current app is a history. You can only view information for the current day. This means that you have no way of looking back and seeing how you slept the day before or yesterday\'s Go-Zone score or even look at this data over any period of time for comparison which could be valuable in analyzing trends. There is also no web-based site you log into for deeper metrics nor is your data currently sent to Jaybird. \n\nNot to worry though, according to update schedule on Jaybird\'s website for the Reign these fixes are underway and planned for this coming January and February 2015. In fact there is some pretty cool features underway like backup to the Regin Cloud, notifications and alerts and access to you activity history. Something Jaybird might consider is a more aggressive update schedule, perhaps every 2 weeks, to attack some of the low-hanging and crucial bugs as well provide an early look at upcoming features and maybe add iCloud support. That small enhancement would have saved my random data loss problem.\n\n(link to first 48 hours review) After unboxing the Reign, I charged up the device for about 3 hours, which was about an hour longer than the directions read. Once fully charged the Reign pod was ready to pair with my iPhone 6. With the Reign on snug on my wrist, I pressed my index finger on top of the band (where the LEDs display) and tapped the pair button in the app. The app displayed that this could take up to 20 seconds. I was patient and probably waited about a minute until eventually it failed. I tried again, this time lightly wetting the contact points as suggested and waited. Again it failed. Out of frustration because pairing a device should not be this difficult, I popped the pod out of the band and licked both sides of it, ensuring it was wet as suggested, and held it between my thumb (bottom side) and index finger. Bam! in less than 5 seconds it paired and I was ready to start moving.\n\nEager to test out the Reign\'s ability to auto-detect different activity types the next day I tried a range of activities. Starting out with a http://bit.ly/1DDUGHY 7-Minute Workout. The Reign successfully logged it as \"Sports\" but for only 2 minutes when it was realistically about 10 minutes. Next up was a short run down the American River and again Reign nailed it. It was a little off on the duration, but it detected the activity correctly. Later in the evening I removed the pod from the wrist band and popped it into the ankle band for a bike ride. The ride was 9.91 miles, about 45 minutes of constant peddling. Unfortunately the Reign failed to recognize this activity type as \"cycling\". In fact the majority of my day resulted in \"general\" activity. It did a good on detecting walking and when I compared the Reign\'s step count to the step count my iPhone 6 reported the two were always within a reasonable to range to each other. I did not test swimming; the lake is too cold right now, but am excited to try it in the spring and maybe with a new Reign with a more robust app.\n\nSo how does this translate into meaningful, actionable guidance? Right now it seems like any other activity tracker, but the Reign goes a next step and each activity gets a \"variable activity score\".  I asked their support what that means and really didn\'t get a clear answer. Although support was extremely responsive as well as interested in my challenges with the device and software. So, from what I surmise is that it is an activity based algorithm that combines exertion and activity into a point system that is used to help set your goals and over time help determine how hard you can push yourself or what activity type you can do to accomplish your daily goal. The goal itself is emphasized with a point value and then suggested activities that would meet that point value. This is okay I suppose but confusing. Why have the points displayed at all? For example, I can ear my 1,609 points with 37 minutes of walking or 16 minutes of running or 22 minutes of cycling. The activity durations make sense to me, the points might as well be something the app just computes without me knowing because it seems like ambiguous data that I don\'t need to know in order to understand and accomplish my daily activity. Metrics are fun to look at though, I guess.\n\nThe third goal is sleep, and according to CMO Rene Oehlerking, \"simply tracking sleep is weak, but how much sleep do you personally need tonight to be at your best tomorrow \". When I heard this I liked the idea and was excited to see how the Reign app presented my sleep and used the metric to determine a better tomorrow. However, my first few nights with the Reign sleep tracking were inconsistent and the automatic sleep detection didn\'t work. In fact, several nights were not tracked and I had to manually enter the hour when I to bed and the hour I woke up. Unfortunately I think this misses all the in-between moments of restless sleep, deep sleep, moments of being awake, etc, so how does the Reign know how much sleep I need tonight if it can\'t consistently track it automatically. And, no where in the app I could find suggestions on when to go to bed based on previous sleep/wake times. In the few days it did successfully track my sleep, the recommendation read, \"You are getting great sleep lately and have been exceeding your ideal nightly sleep duration. Keep it up!\" Amazing, but determined mostly on my manually entries. I think there is great potential in this feature but the Reign certainly fell short in comparison other trackers that automatically track sleep like the Fitbit Charge or Garmin\'s Vivosmart. It also does not have silent, vibrating alarms, which once you start using you will never go back to waking to beeps or radio again.\n\nThe fourth goal is knowing when your body wants to be active or when you need to take a day to recover. This is what Jaybird calls the \"Go-Zone\" and where all this activity recognition and sleep tracking work together, plus one other piece of data that as far as I know other activity trackers don\'t use, which is http://bit.ly/1syWrCn Heart Rate Variability (HRV), or the milliseconds between your heartbeats that can indicate fatigue, stress or in the Reign\'s case, over training.\n\nWhen you wake in the morning, what\'s suppose to happen is your Reign pod (firmware version 3.5.2) syncs with the Regin app of the first time. Unfortunately, in my experience the Reign pod and phone synchronize successfully on the first attempt about 40% of the time. I consistently had to force close the app 3 or 4 times in order to synchronize. Additionally other connected Bluetooth devices would sometimes prevent the pod from synching. This included Jaybird\'s BlueBuds X headphones in my testing, as well my Subaru\'s bluetooth system. \n\nOnce the Reign pod synchronizes your nightly data, which must include sleep whether automatically tracked or manually inputed, the Go-Zone will measure your HRV by resting your finger on the LED band for 2 minutes. When the countdown timer gets to zero your Go-Zone number will appear. If you\'re in the range of 40-60 then your body is ready to be active regardless of what you may \"think\". In the two times that the GO-Zone worked for me it was right on the money. Although I didn\'t \"feel\" like running one day or cycling the next, my Go-Zone was 45 the first day and 65 the second and both days I trusted my Go-Zone reading and just did it and wow, what a great workout I had on both occasions that without the Go-Zone push I probably would have ended up being less active.\n\nDespite all the tripping the Reign and I did through our 10 days of being active together, I would like to try this product again once the software has had a few updates and the synchronization process is more stable. The direction Jaybird is moving with the Regin is unlike any other activity tracker in how it analyzes activity metrics to help you achieve the most activity out of your day, even when you don\'t think you can. \n\nI really like this product and found the majority of my problems with the software. The band is five-star awesome! I will definitely be coming back to the Reign family once I see the reviews on the app store and at Amazon start rising up to where they should be, but Jaybird will not get there anytime soon without healing their app\'s injuries and getting it on more frequent update schedule to earn back consumer\'s trust.','',2098,'2015-01-13 11:57:26','2015-01-14 14:26:31',0,0,0),

The Reign\'s solutions to these four problems make it different from it\'s competition and in many ways better. But like any newly innovated product or idea, it comes with some hiccups and hurdles.\n\nThe first challenge was to eliminate the bulk of the band. Never once did I feel like I was wearing an activity band or device and when positioned just above the wrist joint using a band that fit snug the Reign virtually disappeared, practically becoming an invisible extension of my arm. This made activities from push-ups, burpees and even a simple plank position to writing on a laptop for several hours at a time easy to do and comfortable.  This was a quick win for the Reign over other activity trackers like the Fitbit Flex, Garmin Vivosmart or even Jawbone\'s UP24. It\'s simply the most comfortable activity tracker I have worn. I never thought about taking it off and honestly didn\'t want to. I loved how it felt both physically on my wrist and how it made me feel mentally; visual encouragement.\n\nThe second goal was to create an understanding your daily activity and the meaningful, actionable guidance that you really care about. It\'s not a tracker designed to simply count steps, activities and burned calories. This is done through the Reign\'s mobile app. Currently, as of time of this review, the app is only available for Apple iOS users. Android version will be released January 2015, but as of the 15th it\'s still not appearing in the Google Play Marketplace. The iOS app for the most part delivered on this goal on, but only a high level, without consistency and it\'s important to know that your data is currently, as of version 1.3.3, is only stored on your phone and if for some reason you re-pair or logout of your Reign account the data will erased.\n\nThe first major missing part of the current app is a history. You can only view information for the current day. This means that you have no way of looking back and seeing how you slept the day before or yesterday\'s Go-Zone score or even look at this data over any period of time for comparison which could be valuable in analyzing trends. There is also no web-based site you log into for deeper metrics nor is your data currently sent to Jaybird. \n\nNot to worry though, according to update schedule on Jaybird\'s website for the Reign these fixes are underway and planned for this coming January and February 2015. In fact there is some pretty cool features underway like backup to the Regin Cloud, notifications and alerts and access to you activity history. Something Jaybird might consider is a more aggressive update schedule, perhaps every 2 weeks, to attack some of the low-hanging and crucial bugs as well provide an early look at upcoming features and maybe add iCloud support. That small enhancement would have saved my random data loss problem.\n\n(link to first 48 hours review) After unboxing the Reign, I charged up the device for about 3 hours, which was about an hour longer than the directions read. Once fully charged the Reign pod was ready to pair with my iPhone 6. With the Reign on snug on my wrist, I pressed my index finger on top of the band (where the LEDs display) and tapped the pair button in the app. The app displayed that this could take up to 20 seconds. I was patient and probably waited about a minute until eventually it failed. I tried again, this time lightly wetting the contact points as suggested and waited. Again it failed. Out of frustration because pairing a device should not be this difficult, I popped the pod out of the band and licked both sides of it, ensuring it was wet as suggested, and held it between my thumb (bottom side) and index finger. Bam! in less than 5 seconds it paired and I was ready to start moving.\n\nEager to test out the Reign\'s ability to auto-detect different activity types the next day I tried a range of activities. Starting out with a http://bit.ly/1DDUGHY 7-Minute Workout. The Reign successfully logged it as \"Sports\" but for only 2 minutes when it was realistically about 10 minutes. Next up was a short run down the American River and again Reign nailed it. It was a little off on the duration, but it detected the activity correctly. Later in the evening I removed the pod from the wrist band and popped it into the ankle band for a bike ride. The ride was 9.91 miles, about 45 minutes of constant peddling. Unfortunately the Reign failed to recognize this activity type as \"cycling\". In fact the majority of my day resulted in \"general\" activity. It did a good on detecting walking and when I compared the Reign\'s step count to the step count my iPhone 6 reported the two were always within a reasonable to range to each other. I did not test swimming; the lake is too cold right now, but am excited to try it in the spring and maybe with a new Reign with a more robust app.\n\nSo how does this translate into meaningful, actionable guidance? Right now it seems like any other activity tracker, but the Reign goes a next step and each activity gets a \"variable activity score\".  I asked their support what that means and really didn\'t get a clear answer. Although support was extremely responsive as well as interested in my challenges with the device and software. So, from what I surmise is that it is an activity based algorithm that combines exertion and activity into a point system that is used to help set your goals and over time help determine how hard you can push yourself or what activity type you can do to accomplish your daily goal. The goal itself is emphasized with a point value and then suggested activities that would meet that point value. This is okay I suppose but confusing. Why have the points displayed at all? For example, I can ear my 1,609 points with 37 minutes of walking or 16 minutes of running or 22 minutes of cycling. The activity durations make sense to me, the points might as well be something the app just computes without me knowing because it seems like ambiguous data that I don\'t need to know in order to understand and accomplish my daily activity. Metrics are fun to look at though, I guess.\n\nThe third goal is sleep, and according to CMO Rene Oehlerking, \"simply tracking sleep is weak, but how much sleep do you personally need tonight to be at your best tomorrow \". When I heard this I liked the idea and was excited to see how the Reign app presented my sleep and used the metric to determine a better tomorrow. However, my first few nights with the Reign sleep tracking were inconsistent and the automatic sleep detection didn\'t work. In fact, several nights were not tracked and I had to manually enter the hour when I to bed and the hour I woke up. Unfortunately I think this misses all the in-between moments of restless sleep, deep sleep, moments of being awake, etc, so how does the Reign know how much sleep I need tonight if it can\'t consistently track it automatically. And, no where in the app I could find suggestions on when to go to bed based on previous sleep/wake times. In the few days it did successfully track my sleep, the recommendation read, \"You are getting great sleep lately and have been exceeding your ideal nightly sleep duration. Keep it up!\" Amazing, but determined mostly on my manually entries. I think there is great potential in this feature but the Reign certainly fell short in comparison other trackers that automatically track sleep like the Fitbit Charge or Garmin\'s Vivosmart. It also does not have silent, vibrating alarms, which once you start using you will never go back to waking to beeps or radio again.\n\nThe fourth goal is knowing when your body wants to be active or when you need to take a day to recover. This is what Jaybird calls the \"Go-Zone\" and where all this activity recognition and sleep tracking work together, plus one other piece of data that as far as I know other activity trackers don\'t use, which is http://bit.ly/1syWrCn Heart Rate Variability (HRV), or the milliseconds between your heartbeats that can indicate fatigue, stress or in the Reign\'s case, over training.\n\nWhen you wake in the morning, what\'s suppose to happen is your Reign pod (firmware version 3.5.2) syncs with the Regin app of the first time. Unfortunately, in my experience the Reign pod and phone synchronize successfully on the first attempt about 40% of the time. I consistently had to force close the app 3 or 4 times in order to synchronize. Additionally other connected Bluetooth devices would sometimes prevent the pod from synching. This included Jaybird\'s BlueBuds X headphones in my testing, as well my Subaru\'s bluetooth system. \n\nOnce the Reign pod synchronizes your nightly data, which must include sleep whether automatically tracked or manually inputed, the Go-Zone will measure your HRV by resting your finger on the LED band for 2 minutes. When the countdown timer gets to zero your Go-Zone number will appear. If you\'re in the range of 40-60 then your body is ready to be active regardless of what you may \"think\". In the two times that the GO-Zone worked for me it was right on the money. Although I didn\'t \"feel\" like running one day or cycling the next, my Go-Zone was 45 the first day and 65 the second and both days I trusted my Go-Zone reading and just did it and wow, what a great workout I had on both occasions that without the Go-Zone push I probably would have ended up being less active.\n\nDespite all the tripping the Reign and I did through our 10 days of being active together, I would like to try this product again once the software has had a few updates and the synchronization process is more stable. The direction Jaybird is moving with the Regin is unlike any other activity tracker in how it analyzes activity metrics to help you achieve the most activity out of your day, even when you don\'t think you can. \n\nI really like this product and found the majority of my problems with the software. The band is five-star awesome! I will definitely be coming back to the Reign family once I see the reviews on the app store and at Amazon start rising up to where they should be, but Jaybird will not get there anytime soon without healing their app\'s injuries and getting it on more frequent update schedule to earn back consumer\'s trust.','',2098,'2015-01-13 11:57:26','2015-01-14 14:26:31',0,0,0),

And, there is some truth to that as a matter of fact as well as an ongoing debate on how music should be delivered to your ears. Some want it like Dr. Dre,  tweaking the music to emphasize the bass and vocals, while depressing the \"less interesting\" middle frequencies, thus giving it a sharpness to your ear. Others may want their music a little more flat sounding or prefer it be like a \"CD\" and finally you have the \"the way it was recorded at the studio\" crowd. Defining each of those presets is a little subjective in my opinion and going to be a picky crowd to please. So how do all these online music services like Beats, Spotify and Tidal make everyone happy? With their library selection, price, app interfaces and sound quality.\n\nMy first impression with Beats was \"wow, these tunes are crisp, clear and sharp\" compared to Spotify and so I switched services for 30 days wooed over by Beats sound quality. I was curious on why Beats sounded so much better to me. Both Beats and Spotify stream different qualities of the song based on network type, delivery method (mobile app vs. web app) and membership status.  Beats FAQ http://bit.ly/1y0x5Oq reads, \"On the web, we stream in 320kbps MP3 quality audio - industry standard high quality audio for streaming services.  A small minority of tracks may not be available for 320, in which case we\'ll stream in 256kbps.\"  Spotify\'s FAQ http://bit.ly/1ID2ec8 reads, \"We use 3 quality ratings all in Oog Vorbis format. ~96 kbps for normal quality on mobile; ~160 kbps for desktop and web player standard quality. High quality on mobile is ~320 kbps (only available to Premium subscribers) and is considered high quality on desktop and extreme quality on mobile.\" \n\nThat wasn\'t much of a technical difference but the auditory improvements are quite noticeable. Then at Starbucks one day I was becoming frustrated with Spotify\'s flat sound once again, and it hit me: EQ settings. Spotify has no option to adjust the EQ on their desktop clients, either OS X or Windows. Although, this feature was recently added to their iOS mobile app (not sure about Android).  I googled Beats EQ and bam! I found my answer. Beats automatically applies Dr. Dre\'s EQ settings on the tracks streamed, thus giving them, in my opinion, a superior sound quality. \n\nSo how do I make Spotify sound more like Beats? Or just less flat. Adjust your EQ. On my Macbook Air I simply installed http://goo.gl/iVsYp Soundflower and Apple\'s free Audio Lab app (Windows users will need to google a different solution) then made a few tweaks and now I have better sounding tunes through Spotify. Not exactly the same sound as Beats by Dr. Dre, but much richer in tone with the adjusted settings. \n\n__img__\n\nRemember the quality capabilities of the device you are outputting to have auditory ranges and limitations. Although one EQ settings my be great on your Bose home system they may not work so great on your Skullcandy headphones. I don\'t have a deep technical understanding of all the frequency ranges and just moved the sliders up and down until something sounded great! sounded similar to Beats by Dr. Dre.\n\nJim, why not just save yourself some time and use Beats in the first place? I tried it for 45 days and found the curated playlists to be out of date. During the 2014 holidays, Beats was suggesting playlists titled \"Christmas 2012\" and \"Best songs of 2011\". In addition, Beats has no radio style feature relying entirely on its community to create relevant playlists of relevant music.\n\nSpotify on the other hand has radio based on genre or similar to Pandora you can create your own station. In addition, Spotify also has curated playlists and a rather unexplored area of Spotify include apps which give you an interesting interaction with services like last.fm and pitchfork that add value to my music listening experience in a similar way that I listen to music.\n\nYou have probably noticed that most of these services are price driven, with Spotify clearly being the winner in my opinion for family at $9.99 a month +$5 a month additional family members, then recently with Beats lowering it\'s price to $9.99 month or $99 a year (that\'s basically getting 2 months free) and finally Tidal which brands itself as offering \"high fidelity music\" at a whopping cost of $20 a month. Even with my incredible Jaybird BlueBud X earbuds I don\'t think I could hear a $10 month difference while running or cycling or sitting in Starbucks, but I also haven\'t tried the service out yet; a free 7-day trial requiring my credit card tastes sour to me.\n\nOn a last note, choose the music service that fits your listening style.

Wooed by its design and fresh thinking for activity trackers, which is to give meaning to your steps, activity and heart information above just showing a metric on a pretty graph, I was ready to join this team and go beyond counting my steps and calories burned.  I was pumped to run, swim and bike!\n\nJaybird raced into the fitness world with their  remarkable sounding and highly acclaimed http://bit.ly/1y99BFA Bluebuds X Bluetooth Headphones and the new family member, Reign,  has the same great showmanship qualities and thought-though innovative design. During my 10 day evaluation I tested whether the Reign lives up to creator\'s vision http://bit.ly/1u2doGb and mantra of \"knowing when your body wants to be active\". \n\nFrom the start, the Reign received Best of Show awards from http://bit.ly/1xvb7CT Engadget, Slashgear and Outdoor Retailer. It clearly earns these accolades for its smooth silicone band that is sexy, durable, waterproof -not just resistant- and most comfortable to wear design that is functional as well as fashionable. \n\nLike me, you are probably sold too, especially after watching the videos on the Reign website, but in a tight race of other activity trackers where price point is crucial,  the Reign has to smoke the competition at $199 MSRP ($217 total with tax for me, which is a lot of money for an activity tracker but comparable -on the high side- in it\'s category which includes heart monitoring and usually some small notification features).\n\nAccording to Founder & CEO Judd Armstrong and CMO Rene Oehlerking the Reign has four problems to solve. The Reign\'s solutions to these four problems make it different from it\'s competition and in many ways better. But like any newly innovated product or idea, it comes with some hiccups and hurdles.\n\nThe first challenge was to eliminate the bulk of the band. Never once did I feel like I was wearing an activity band or device and when positioned just above the wrist joint using a band that fit snug the Reign virtually disappeared, practically becoming an invisible extension of my arm. This made activities from push-ups, burpees and even a simple plank position to writing on a laptop for several hours at a time easy to do and comfortable.  This was a quick win for the Reign over other activity trackers like the Fitbit Flex, Garmin Vivosmart or even Jawbone\'s UP24. It\'s simply the most comfortable activity tracker I have worn. I never thought about taking it off and honestly didn\'t want to. I loved how it felt both physically on my wrist and how it made me feel mentally; visual encouragement.\n\nThe second goal was to create an understanding your daily activity and the meaningful, actionable guidance that you really care about. It\'s not a tracker designed to simply count steps, activities and burned calories. This is done through the Reign\'s mobile app. Currently, as of time of this review, the app is only available for Apple iOS users. Android version will be released January 2015, but as of the 15th it\'s still not appearing in the Google Play Marketplace. The iOS app for the most part delivered on this goal on, but only a high level, without consistency and it\'s important to know that your data is currently, as of version 1.3.3, is only stored on your phone and if for some reason you re-pair or logout of your Reign account the data will erased.\n\nThe first major missing part of the current app is a history. You can only view information for the current day. This means that you have no way of looking back and seeing how you slept the day before or yesterday\'s Go-Zone score or even look at this data over any period of time for comparison which could be valuable in analyzing trends. There is also no web-based site you log into for deeper metrics nor is your data currently sent to Jaybird. \n\nNot to worry though, according to update schedule on Jaybird\'s website for the Reign these fixes are underway and planned for this coming January and February 2015. In fact there is some pretty cool features underway like backup to the Regin Cloud, notifications and alerts and access to you activity history. Something Jaybird might consider is a more aggressive update schedule, perhaps every 2 weeks, to attack some of the low-hanging and crucial bugs as well provide an early look at upcoming features and maybe add iCloud support. That small enhancement would have saved my random data loss problem.\n\n(link to first 48 hours review) After unboxing the Reign, I charged up the device for about 3 hours, which was about an hour longer than the directions read. Once fully charged the Reign pod was ready to pair with my iPhone 6. With the Reign on snug on my wrist, I pressed my index finger on top of the band (where the LEDs display) and tapped the pair button in the app. The app displayed that this could take up to 20 seconds. I was patient and probably waited about a minute until eventually it failed. I tried again, this time lightly wetting the contact points as suggested and waited. Again it failed. Out of frustration because pairing a device should not be this difficult, I popped the pod out of the band and licked both sides of it, ensuring it was wet as suggested, and held it between my thumb (bottom side) and index finger. Bam! in less than 5 seconds it paired and I was ready to start moving.\n\nEager to test out the Reign\'s ability to auto-detect different activity types the next day I tried a range of activities. Starting out with a http://bit.ly/1DDUGHY 7-Minute Workout. The Reign successfully logged it as \"Sports\" but for only 2 minutes when it was realistically about 10 minutes. Next up was a short run down the American River and again Reign nailed it. It was a little off on the duration, but it detected the activity correctly. Later in the evening I removed the pod from the wrist band and popped it into the ankle band for a bike ride. The ride was 9.91 miles, about 45 minutes of constant peddling. Unfortunately the Reign failed to recognize this activity type as \"cycling\". In fact the majority of my day resulted in \"general\" activity. It did a good on detecting walking and when I compared the Reign\'s step count to the step count my iPhone 6 reported the two were always within a reasonable to range to each other. I did not test swimming; the lake is too cold right now, but am excited to try it in the spring and maybe with a new Reign with a more robust app.\n\nSo how does this translate into meaningful, actionable guidance? Right now it seems like any other activity tracker, but the Reign goes a next step and each activity gets a \"variable activity score\".  I asked their support what that means and really didn\'t get a clear answer. Although support was extremely responsive as well as interested in my challenges with the device and software. So, from what I surmise is that it is an activity based algorithm that combines exertion and activity into a point system that is used to help set your goals and over time help determine how hard you can push yourself or what activity type you can do to accomplish your daily goal. The goal itself is emphasized with a point value and then suggested activities that would meet that point value. This is okay I suppose but confusing. Why have the points displayed at all? For example, I can ear my 1,609 points with 37 minutes of walking or 16 minutes of running or 22 minutes of cycling. The activity durations make sense to me, the points might as well be something the app just computes without me knowing because it seems like ambiguous data that I don\'t need to know in order to understand and accomplish my daily activity. Metrics are fun to look at though, I guess.\n\nThe third goal is sleep, and according to CMO Rene Oehlerking, \"simply tracking sleep is weak, but how much sleep do you personally need tonight to be at your best tomorrow \". When I heard this I liked the idea and was excited to see how the Reign app presented my sleep and used the metric to determine a better tomorrow. However, my first few nights with the Reign sleep tracking were inconsistent and the automatic sleep detection didn\'t work. In fact, several nights were not tracked and I had to manually enter the hour when I to bed and the hour I woke up. Unfortunately I think this misses all the in-between moments of restless sleep, deep sleep, moments of being awake, etc, so how does the Reign know how much sleep I need tonight if it can\'t consistently track it automatically. And, no where in the app I could find suggestions on when to go to bed based on previous sleep/wake times. In the few days it did successfully track my sleep, the recommendation read, \"You are getting great sleep lately and have been exceeding your ideal nightly sleep duration. Keep it up!\" Amazing, but determined mostly on my manually entries. I think there is great potential in this feature but the Reign certainly fell short in comparison other trackers that automatically track sleep like the Fitbit Charge or Garmin\'s Vivosmart. It also does not have silent, vibrating alarms, which once you start using you will never go back to waking to beeps or radio again.\n\nThe fourth goal is knowing when your body wants to be active or when you need to take a day to recover. This is what Jaybird calls the \"Go-Zone\" and where all this activity recognition and sleep tracking work together, plus one other piece of data that as far as I know other activity trackers don\'t use, which is http://bit.ly/1syWrCn Heart Rate Variability (HRV), or the milliseconds between your heartbeats that can indicate fatigue, stress or in the Reign\'s case, over training.\n\nWhen you wake in the morning, what\'s suppose to happen is your Reign pod (firmware version 3.5.2) syncs with the Regin app of the first time. Unfortunately, in my experience the Reign pod and phone synchronize successfully on the first attempt about 40% of the time. I consistently had to force close the app 3 or 4 times in order to synchronize. Additionally other connected Bluetooth devices would sometimes prevent the pod from synching. This included Jaybird\'s BlueBuds X headphones in my testing, as well my Subaru\'s bluetooth system. \n\nOnce the Reign pod synchronizes your nightly data, which must include sleep whether automatically tracked or manually inputed, the Go-Zone will measure your HRV by resting your finger on the LED band for 2 minutes. When the countdown timer gets to zero your Go-Zone number will appear. If you\'re in the range of 40-60 then your body is ready to be active regardless of what you may \"think\". In the two times that the GO-Zone worked for me it was right on the money. Although I didn\'t \"feel\" like running one day or cycling the next, my Go-Zone was 45 the first day and 65 the second and both days I trusted my Go-Zone reading and just did it and wow, what a great workout I had on both occasions that without the Go-Zone push I probably would have ended up being less active.\n\nDespite all the tripping the Reign and I did through our 10 days of being active together, I would like to try this product again once the software has had a few updates and the synchronization process is more stable. The direction Jaybird is moving with the Regin is unlike any other activity tracker in how it analyzes activity metrics to help you achieve the most activity out of your day, even when you don\'t think you can. \n\nI really like this product and found the majority of my problems with the software. The band is five-star awesome! I will definitely be coming back to the Reign family once I see the reviews on the app store and at Amazon start rising up to where they should be, but Jaybird will not get there anytime soon without healing their app\'s injuries and getting it on more frequent update schedule to earn back consumer\'s trust.','',2098,'2015-01-13 11:57:26','2015-01-14 14:26:31',0,0,0),

	(251,110,36,1,1,'2015, The Year of the Wearable','Happy New Year! and welcome to the next year of technology: wearables and connected devices. During the last half of 2014 I\'m sure you read many, many blog postings, tweets and news posts regarding wearable technology and connected devices.\n\nIf you were at CES 2014 last year then you were one of the lucky people to see some of upcoming wearable technology hands-on. Everything from Samsung\'s Gear, Apple\'s Watch, Google Glass, FitBit\'s new Charge devices to Microsoft\'s shocking entry into fitness tech. It\'s a whirl-wind of step counting, calorie tracking, sleep analysis, wireless, turn-your-thermostat-on-and-coffee-maker-off-all-from-desk-chair-at-work-world that is starting to get competitive.<!--more-->\n\nOver the past four months I have gotten my feet wet in this wearable, connected-device world through activity or fitness tracking devices. First with a FitBit Flex, then a Misfit Flash, FitBit Charge and most recently Garmin\'s Vivosmart. It\'s an affordable way, $99 to $180, to introduce yourself and play in a new market, a new tech-trend that isn\'t on the higher-end price range of more sophisticated wearables like Samsung\'s Gear Neo, Apple\'s Watch, Moto 360 or Pebble.\n\nWhether it\'s activity tracking, turning on and off lights from another city or extending the features of your current smartphone, the first question you should ask yourself is: What is my goal? This is going to help you decide what kind of wearable or connected device will work best.\n\nIf your goal is wanting to turn up the heat in the house on a colder than usual day or not have to worry about unlocking your front door with your hands full of grocery bags, then you will be searching for a connected device versus a wearable. <a href=\"https://nest.com\">Nest</a> or <a href=\"http://www.insteon.com\">Insteon</a> offer some great Wi-Fi thermostats and <a href=\"https://lockitron.com\">Lockitron</a> or <a href=\"http://danalock.com\">Danalock</a> have some easy ways to convert your existing deadbolt into a wireless lock using Bluetooth. So as long as you have your phone, you will have a way to unlock your front door, as well as turn up the heat or cool down AC on a hot day. There are also Wi-fi enabled light bulbs and electrical switches becoming available. Imagine having the control to turn on your family room TV in Sacramento, California from Paris, France. Why? Why not.\n\nHowever, maybe your goal is that you want to use tech to help you become more active? or maybe shed a few of those holiday pounds? A basic activity tracking wearable device, like Fitbit\'s Flex, Jawbone\'s Up24 or Garmin\'s Vivofit will track steps and report calorie burn, providing you with daily/weekly/monthly graphs and charts helping you to attain your goal. Fitbit takes it a step further providing a food diary within its mobile app. Each device has it\'s own unique strategy (or \"science\" in Fitbit\'s case) so take the time to read the reviews on Amazon as well as download the device\'s software and look at it. Do your research, because even though activity trackers all basically do the same thing -step counters- there are major feature differences and gaps in mobile software, which you may or may not want or discover the perfect device -band wise- but the software is lacking. This I feel is the case for the sexy and expensive <a href=\"http://www.jaybirdsport.com/reign-activity-tracker/\">Jaybird Reign.</a> Incredibly well made and designed band, but trips itself up in half-baked software, making it really hard to invest $200 on an activity tracker that can\'t show you any stats from the previous day or have a web based interface or online community. But, it does have some unique features like Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and focuses less on calorie intake and burn and more on just being active and using its machine intelligence (data the device collects) to help you be better at the fitness you love to do and predicting the days you will be best at it.\n\nNow, if you want apps, a calendar, send/receive calls and texts then you have just leveled-up your requirements and may consider a smart-watch. Although some fitness bands like Microsoft\'s fitband, Fitbit\'s upcoming Surge and Garmin\'s Vivosmart also provide \"smart-notifications\", or they display alerts for calls, texts and notifications usually on a small OLED display; however, this accomplished with limitations and that\'s where the smart-watch adds functionality.\n\nMost of these smart-watch devices will allow you answer a call from your wrist, as well as send a text using your voice. They also count steps, stairs and distances like activity trackers, appealing to a high-level of health goals but at the end of the day of trying to be that all-in-one wearable that does everything; okay. This may not be your cup of tea, and ultimately end up disappointing you because most smart-watches are still tightly coupled with having their master (the phone) nearby in order to reasonably work as advertised, which in my opinion almost defeats their purpose. If I am spending $349 on an Apple Watch it needs to have the following tech in: activity tracker functions, GPS, offline music playback, touch screen, waterproof (not resistant), somewhat ruggedized, but work without requiring that my phone has to be 50 feet from the watch.\n\nThere is one problem that all wearables whether smart-watches or activity trackers share is the lack of adequate or expandable device memory for offline features like playing music, voicemail and data storage that keeps our phone tethered to us in circumstances, like running, swimming, biking, or just a big house, where the purpose of having a wearable device is to simplify your tech for the task at hand.\n\nSo what\'s the answer? Use the tool that does the job and does it well. Would you use a screw driver to drive a nail into a piece of wood? I think you understand what I am getting to and can use other similar analogies to make a great decision on what kind of wearable or connected device that will best fit your needs and your lifestyle.','',985,'2015-01-01 13:18:50','2015-01-02 17:03:42',0,0,0),

	(268,43,2,1,1,'Bedside Manners','\"I\'m going to read\" she said bumping his laptop with her foot by accident while slipping off the couch. He passed her an inconspicuous glance indicating his disinterest in silence and lack of presence. She smiled with a cute, \"I\'m sorry,\" but all she saw was his email reflected in his glasses. She felt a ponderous sadness pass through her walking down the hall to the bedroom.\n\nThe nightstand lamp dimly lit the room. Above the short, but long bookcase, a tv was mounted on the wall, her jewelry box and a silver necklace laid on the surface along with a family photo from last November. They all wore matching blue jeans and white t-shirts and posed against country style wooden fence, the ground sprinkled by autumn colors. Their smiles hid the exhaustive argument that had on the way to the park. A circular votive candle holder hung over the bed but never used. The bed was made, as she always made it after they showered in the morning, and a small chair sat in each corner of the bedroom with her night shirt flung over one of them and his sweat pants on the other. Slippers tucked underneath. \n\nUndressing from the day, she pulled the night shirt over her heard and kneeled beside the bed pulling out an old shoe box that had a large orange sales sticker on it. She took out a small brown leather journal then pushed the box back where she kept it hidden from everyone; sometimes even herself.\n\nTossing the sheets aside, she laid down and opened the journal.\n\nAugust 14, 2009\n\"Okay, you can give me a hug,\" she said to me, looking at me warmly with eyes smiling from the inside out and a voice that I knew. Our hearts beat against each other. I didnâ€™t want to let go as our hearts made out like love-crazy teenagers, and stood there in the middle of the Subway parking lot captivated by one another until our arms fell to their sides holding hands. I glanced down and saw our fingers interlocked in a sweet yet complicated reunion, then back into her blue eyes where I am forever found. The tan line on her finger explained what she wouldn\'t tell me until I drove 1,374 miles to see her. It was too already too late because it didn\'t matter to either one of us. We had already fallen in love with no more than a hug and touch of the hand, and I knew that I wanted was to take her with me into the rest of my life. On the drive back to California she texted, \"I want to feel you inside me.\" A tease that lead to the most enjoyable drive through the Great Salt Lake. #end\n\nRemember the sexting of that day, her cheeks blushed the color of her lipstick which she hadn\'t taken off yet, bite the corner of her lower lip, touching herself in a way she also remembered him touching her on that midnight rendezvous outside the movie theater and then again in the hotel room a month later.\n\nShe turned the page, moistening her fingers and sliding them under her shorts and kept reading. The soft brush of her wet finger feeling her sensitive skin. A tickle sensation flowed through her body while she massaged herself slowly with one hand, turning pages of the journal with the other. \n\nA soft moan as her finger moved slightly faster, a light tingling sensation building as fingers became wetter and dipped into her discovering a warm, sticky pleasure. \n\nShe turned the next page.\n\nSeptember 15, 2009.\nI can\'t explain how wonderful today was. After another really long 17 hour, stop for gas and pee-break only drive she stood in front me with those angelic eyes and immediately grabbed my lips with hers. \"Do you have any music?\" she asked me. I opened the laptop on the nightstand next to me and put on the playlist she made for me: Keep Me In Your Thoughts by Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers filled the room. She stood at the foot of the bed, shoulder length blonde hair looking me in nothing but her blue panties and matching bra and seductive \"come and get me\" smile. My eyes lusting up and down her petite body as it crawled on top of me taking my lips into her mouth. She held me, hard, moving her hand, while my erection grew longer and my hand slipped under her panties feeling the warm, wet, sticky pleasure of her sex, finger sinking slowly inside her fire. She moaned and rocked her hips a few times then spun on top of me, grinding her warm, moist sex against my balls. Her boobs looked down at me filling her bra and wiggling to pop out into my hands. She rubbed down against me harder letting the tip slide inside her, slippery and warm. After a few pokes I pushed inside her, then back slowly, starting a rhythm: up and down, back and forth. She gyrated her hips whispering, \"I love how you feel inside me,\" as the sensation spread, swinging her hips back into me again. I felt the tip touch a soft pillow. It was warm, tingling, erotic. I held it there feeling the inside of wet and happy flower suck the tip the of my penis, tight, warm and hot. She squeezed her legs into my side and moaned, \"I want to feel you cum inside me,\" and I rolled on top of her. I unsnapped her bra. She wiggled it off her arms my hand cupping her squishy boobs, my thumbs circling her nipples; our mouths open and tongues tango.  We start the pattern again: left to right and up and down, and down again and slowly in and out. A sensuous tempo. The pleasure desiring to release tickled by a growing sensation from my toes to my finger tips which firmly sat on her belly, balancing me as I moved inside her somewhere in between slow and then deep and faster and then slower until her finger nails lightly ran down my shoulders and sides of my back while her soul was massaged by an exhaustive orgasm. I was about to cum and pushed deep inside her until I felt that soft, warm pillow of love surrounded by our warm release. My lips buried in her neck, feeling completely vulnerable yet totally satisfied.  She whispered, \"I love you\". #end\n\nShe slipped her hand out from under panties back over her belly and between her breasts with a self-satisfied sigh. His silhouette stood in the door watching her.\n\n\"What are you reading?\" he asked with a curiosity and stretched himself out on the bed beside her. His hand rested on top of her bare, naked leg stroking its smoothness along the inside of her thigh. She was wet and aroused from the story, sensitive to his touch. She shivered and took a long breath before returning him a seductive smile and closed the pages of the brown journal. \n\nLicking her fingers she reached through his boxers, rubbing his dick hard while circling her tongue with his and then along his lips in a long passionate kiss. His hand rushed over her belly button under her shirt grabbing her breasts, squeezing them and then down again between her legs tugging her panties from around her knees. She slid her back down the pillow flipping him and he dropped on top of her; his boxers tugged off with her feet and she opened her legs on each side of him. He easily fell inside her wet sensuous pleasure.\n\nShe moaned quietly to herself staring at the ceiling while he rocked in and out; wet, smooth, warm and fast. She put her hand on his shoulder escaping back into the memories, the words she just read while waiting for him to finish.

The situation of me and Aimee and the affair from I guess two years ago. There is no more affair. There is no more \"us\". I\'m not sure why I hold on, or where I continue to keep something alive that is clearly not anymore.

After you leave your bootcamp sessions and riding, swimming, running, and you get home and help Seth with his homework and put him to sleep do you feel like there is something missing? I stopped in front of your house at 2:15 AM last night. It looked like the front door was open. Do you ever just go for middle of the night walks?</p>\n\nI always come back to this spot - NEVRQIT - look on mamabootcamps Instagram (22 weeks ago) then look at my Instagram (44 weeks ago). Tell me if you see it, and feel it too. I don\'t believe in coincidences. Do you? In some weird way, all of it is connected. For whatever reason, some force is working even when we aren\'t talking or looking or loving each other to make sure we don\'t forget about each other. \"\n- - -\n\nBut outside of this drama that I keep going for reasons that still, five years later, escape me, life has been a total collapse. I wish just for once I could write in a journal with happy words. Tell a story about a vacation or a great day that I had, but there haven\'t been any in so long.

In fact, it was at this exact same spot on this Hill she told me three years before. I thought about her note declaring her love and feelings for me that she handed me that windy day. The raw vulnerability of her words held close to my heart until the day she lied about everything she had written in those pages. Those words crumpled into a meaningless excuse. It was just a fling she said. Words that were crafted by the emotional loss of her child that did not mean what they said: I care for you but I don\'t love you like they read or like what I read her lips say to me that day on the hill.\n\nIt was different this time though. Today, there was no fear of consequence or talks about being controlled, or guilted into trying to make her marriage work any longer. She was in a better place this time. I could feel the peace she had finally found in her difficult decision after so many years of struggle, depression and dominance over her life. Her eyes exposed a courage that I remember the first time I had looked into them and saw our life together just as I remember that day in Colorado. \n\nHer hands slid down my side, the tender kiss coming to close, she said, \"I love you and want to be together now.\"\n\nOur connection no longer had to reach through dreams or decipher cryptic messages or hide in the shadows of our deception anymore. We stood on top the Hill this time unconstrained by the complexities of our fears -free to love at last and scream it from the mountain top if we wanted to or whisper it into each other\'s ear in bed without guilt. This time she meant it.\n\n\"Look,\" she said, pointing to a red-tail hawk circling above our heads, playing in a thermal, \"it\'s like everything is right where it\'s suppose to be now,\" watching the bird glide in circles until it perched on a rock below. \"It only took us five years,\" she said with a small chuckle, looking at my half smile, still sad for how I hurt her, \"and I know a lot of heartache,\" she said taking my hand and we started hiking back down the hill, following a narrow trail of dirt and rock that slipped under our shoes making a crunching sound.\n\n\"Hold on,\" she said. The sun was setting over the Sierra\'s to the West. I could see my old smiling face in her eyes from five years earlier.\n\n\"This is where I kissed you last time\", she said, \"do you remember?\" she asked, sliding her hands into the front pockets of my jeans like she did before.

	(333,128,2,1,1,'Part 1, Second Chances ',' \nIf you have a choice between me and him,\nchoose him, because if you really loved me,\nyou wouldnâ€™t have to choose.\n\nSECOND CHANCES, March 23, 2011 | An uncomfortable darkness crept down the wishing well. Night was beginning to rise. I looked at her with a sad concern, ignoring her excitement about the mysterious door, â€œYou know youâ€™ll be late getting home,â€ she caught my quick watch glance.\nâ€œItâ€™s alright,â€ she replied, â€œLet me worry about that.â€ Her hand was warm, on top of mine. Shouldnâ€™t this be other way around? Me convincing her it will be alright and her a little freaked out at what her husband is going to ask, especially since he is aware of us and the affair. Maybe he doesnâ€™t care and why is that I wondered. Then it hit me, he doesnâ€™t have to care. He knows she wonâ€™t leave. I ran my finger over her wedding ring. The rigid points of the diamonds and smooth white gold. Even in the dimly lit wishing well it sparkled; laughing at me, mocking me, my foolish weak heart.\nâ€œWhy do you wear it when weâ€™re together?â€ I asked, curious. â€œMy hands are swollen,â€ she said, pulling it back, looking down at her ring, â€œand it wonâ€™t come off right now,â€ sounding a little sorry about it, â€œbut you know it doesnâ€™t change anything if I take it off.â€\nThe mood changed as quickly as day was turning to night. I tried to stay in the moment, stay in the fantasy of us while we were together, but the sharp reflection of stone pierced my heart. She knows that it bothers me and that I donâ€™t understand who I am to her. Maybe we donâ€™t understand who are to each other?\nâ€œWhat are we doing?â€ I asked out loud, not realizing.\nIt was barely bright enough to see her face, but I could hear her sigh, hurt and getting angry with me, â€œI thought we were spending time together and unlocking a mysterious door at the bottom of an enchanting wishing well,â€ a pause, â€œI guess I was wrong,â€ disappointed.\nI donâ€™t know, I sat thinking, â€œI wonder if this is what happened to those two fate-struck lovers,â€ I said looking back up through the wishing well, hoping to salvage the romantic-adventure mood by comparing us to something that only existed in folklore. â€œWe know they were in love, like us,â€ I said, smiling, â€œbut couldnâ€™t be together, like us,â€ I continued, â€œand that they lived in a special place, like us, waiting for the day they could be, like us.â€\nShe looked at me with a half-smile Iâ€™m guessing trying to appreciate my effort and answered, â€œMaybe,â€ but not sounding too convinced of the pretend parallel I was suggesting because she asked quite unsympathetically â€œWhy do you have to constantly push me?â€\nâ€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ God I say that a lot. I couldnâ€™t look at her anymore, feeling guilt once again for trying to just figure out what the hell all of this is sometimes, because the truth, based not on what she says to me but her actions invade my conscious thoughts all day long. I just need to talk about it and figure out where itâ€™s all going and what Iâ€™m doing with my life, thinking, my life with her, but not with her.\nMy thoughts agitated me and whatever mood I had previously rescued the moment before was lost not a second after this one slipped out loud again, â€œItâ€™s just,â€ I paused, â€œbeen almost three years now and weâ€™re still here. We only exist in a place of plausible deniability, at any moment Iâ€™m no one to you, and then Iâ€™m your world, and then,â€ breathing deeply, sad, â€œI donâ€™t want to face the truth, but your actions, theyâ€\nâ€œStop,â€ she interrupted.\nI no longer knew who I was to her or even what it is weâ€™re doing anymore; although happy to see her again, but also frustrated and hurt by those actions. I just couldnâ€™t ignore it any longer. Our last argument over the same conversation ended with some of her last words to be being, â€œhow do you know he wonâ€™t leaveâ€. Four months of silence and one word texts every now and then to remind me she was still around, heâ€™s still there and weâ€™re still stuck in the same place; still hopelessly in love but not willing to do anything about it but disagree and she does everything to protect her marriageâ€™s second chance, yet finds me.\nâ€œI feel like we live in two different worlds sometimes.â€ â€œWe do,â€ she said, â€œand Iâ€™m not ready to be in yours right now. Youâ€™re special to me and I like having fun with you,â€ she said, â€œnot this, but fun,â€ paused moment, eyes in the directions of her ring, â€œbut Iâ€™m where I am suppose to be right now.â€ With my son, she thought to herself.\nâ€œMaybe the woman,â€ she said, voice cracking, â€œin the story didnâ€™t show up because she was afraid of something,â€ upset, â€œlike loosing her son if she left,â€ crying, I couldnâ€™t look at her anymore. My dark, emotional shroud smothered the excitement, mystery and adventure that once filled this bucket. She gathered herself and continued, â€œI know how she would feel,â€ voice broken and shallow, â€œI wouldnâ€™t go anywhere without my son.â€\nWe sat staring at each other, no-one talking again, waiting for the next word as we both cried and I wrestled with feelings and rationalizing her actions, thinking, Iâ€™m sure she is staying for her son, partially, but, clearly, things arenâ€™t so bad with her married life that it would be in the childâ€™s best interest for them to get a divorce. They made a baby after all of this started, so they are still connected to some degree. Then again sex is part of marriage, itâ€™s sometimes even the reason people get married, but thereâ€™s birth control. If she didnâ€™t love him she would have taken precautions. I struggled with this thought, then again she was married, so there isnâ€™t any real consequence or benefit and technically she was doing nothing wrong. Thinking that didnâ€™t prevent the hurt from spreading through me, wild fire, burning my love and compassion. I didnâ€™t doubt that she loves me in some way, I finally decided, after the fire in me died, that she loves her husband and her son more. Why canâ€™t we just talk about this?\nI heard her slide her shoes back and the soft crinkle of her jacket wrap her arms around her knees. There was a chill in the air but I think she was more uncomfortable than cold. The evening certainly did not go the way I had planned and it was my fault. I havenâ€™t been able to forget sheâ€™s married, and every since her husband learned about our affair, because in my insanity of anger I told everyone about us with complete disregard to the consequences.\nâ€œDo you love him?â€\nâ€œOf course I love him. Thatâ€™s not the issue. Itâ€™s more how do I. And do not ask me to answer that question.â€\nI expected her to say no. Our knees bent, shoes touching, my hope for our future together, even if trapped in a fantasy world shattered by those words, of course I love him, still resonate, echoing off the walls, colliding with the sharp recollection of the how that I just wanted to forget.\nâ€œWhat am I to you then?â€ I couldnâ€™t stop pushing. I needed her to say it again. My ego needed to hear it. I felt a blob of angry jealousy and insecurity in me. Hurt. How in the world could she love him?\nâ€œYou mean wonder and hope to me,â€ she finally answered, my runaway conversation with myself sharply interrupted, â€œand happiness,â€ she took a breath, â€œfriendship and unconditional love and support and safety to me.â€\nUnconditional Love. My heart sank. Instantly I realized I am not being the person I have felt that I have been to her for a thousand years. If I loved her, as I say I do, then why did I every do those things to her and why I get angry with her I just donâ€™t talk. Oh, yeah, she doesnâ€™t answer back now because I use what she says and conveys it to her husband. Why do I that? Because if she wonâ€™t leave, maybe he will.\nâ€œIt was easier when no one knew,â€ I felt my words soften as guilt for ruining the secret of our affair spoke to me. I was upset when she chose him over me and told everyone I knew. We talked about it a little, but the anger was still there.\nâ€œWell whoâ€™s fault is that?â€ she said straight forward. â€œMine, and I am sorry.â€\nâ€œAre you?â€ she asked, â€œyou keep doing it.â€ Her hand finally touched mine and she scooted into to me. I could feel the warmth of her breathing, her legs wrapping around my waist and she put her hand on my heart close enough that I could see her face, but not the blue in her eyes, â€œListenâ€, she said poking me, â€œIâ€™m here with you right now. Does that say anything to you?â€\nThe reality of our circumstance is simple. Weâ€™re having an affair. It will end the moment I get irrationally jealous and angry and seek revenge on her marriage and she stops talking.\nI smiled at her, ran my finger down her cheek wiping a warm tear away.

Shouldnâ€™t this be other way around? Me convincing her it will be alright and her a little freaked out at what her husband is going to ask, especially since he is aware of us and the affair.

The rigid points of the diamonds and smooth white gold. Even in the dimly lit wishing well it sparkled; laughing at me, mocking me, my foolish weak heart.\nâ€œWhy do you wear it when weâ€™re together?â€ I asked, curious. â€œMy hands are swollen,â€ she said, pulling it back, looking down at her ring, â€œand it wonâ€™t come off right now,â€ sounding a little sorry about it, â€œbut you know it doesnâ€™t change anything if I take it off.â€\nThe mood changed as quickly as day was turning to night.

Maybe we donâ€™t understand who are to each other?\nâ€œWhat are we doing?â€ I asked out loud, not realizing.\nIt was barely bright enough to see her face, but I could hear her sigh, hurt and getting angry with me, â€œI thought we were spending time together and unlocking a mysterious door at the bottom of an enchanting wishing well,â€ a pause, â€œI guess I was wrong,â€ disappointed.\nI donâ€™t know, I sat thinking, â€œI wonder if this is what happened to those two fate-struck lovers,â€ I said looking back up through the wishing well, hoping to salvage the romantic-adventure mood by comparing us to something that only existed in folklore. â€œWe know they were in love, like us,â€ I said, smiling, â€œbut couldnâ€™t be together, like us,â€ I continued, â€œand that they lived in a special place, like us, waiting for the day they could be, like us.â€\nShe looked at me with a half-smile Iâ€™m guessing trying to appreciate my effort and answered, â€œMaybe,â€ but not sounding too convinced of the pretend parallel I was suggesting because she asked quite unsympathetically â€œWhy do you have to constantly push me?â€\nâ€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ God I say that a lot. I couldnâ€™t look at her anymore, feeling guilt once again for trying to just figure out what the hell all of this is sometimes, because the truth, based not on what she says to me but her actions invade my conscious thoughts all day long. I just need to talk about it and figure out where itâ€™s all going and what Iâ€™m doing with my life, thinking, my life with her, but not with her.\nMy thoughts agitated me and whatever mood I had previously rescued the moment before was lost not a second after this one slipped out loud again, â€œItâ€™s just,â€ I paused, â€œbeen almost three years now and weâ€™re still here.

I just couldnâ€™t ignore it any longer. Our last argument over the same conversation ended with some of her last words to be being, â€œhow do you know he wonâ€™t leaveâ€. Four months of silence and one word texts every now and then to remind me she was still around, heâ€™s still there and weâ€™re still stuck in the same place; still hopelessly in love but not willing to do anything about it but disagree and she does everything to protect her marriageâ€™s second chance, yet finds me.\nâ€œI feel like we live in two different worlds sometimes.â€ â€œWe do,â€ she said, â€œand Iâ€™m not ready to be in yours right now.

The women said he was a hopeless romantic, poet, followed his heart to a fault and the woman had beautiful, long hair, strands of gold with a nurturing heart. She always around town, tending to her chores as a dutiful wife and was often seen at the edge of a large meadow picnicking with her son under a tall oak tree.â€\n\nâ€œI bet that was the tree,â€ Sarah said pointing through the fountain\'s canopy and across the field to an open space where a creek flowed under a small foot bridge. Itâ€™s large trunk held up the towering, twisted branches with chunks of bark shedding themselves from the cold winter. I looked into excited and happy blue eyes, agreeing with her. \"Tell me more,\" she said connecting our eyes.\n\n\"The townspeople described their presence together as aura of peace surrounding them and that their smiles would turn winter into summer as they walked by,\" Sarah smiled absorbing the nature and peace surrounding her.

Return here in ten days from tomorrow and we will leave this place and finally be together.*\n\nAs she told him, he returned to the bridge ten days later ready run away and begin a new life with her.

	(356,132,2,1,1,'Somewhere Only We Knew','â€œHow did you find this place?â€\n\nâ€œI bet itâ€™s beautiful when its not so cold and frozen,â€ she said while admiring the old stones of the cobblestone fountain and looking lost in a world of enchantment, â€œin fact, we could have a picnic under that tree by the creek and bridge,â€ she said placing her hand on the winter-trapped vine twisting itâ€™s dead looking arms along while I was watched a large hawk swoop towards us from the treetops and perch itself on the canopy; curious.\n\nThe folklore people pass around in these parts is that the fountain and bridge were built back before the beginning of time by a young couple who were trapped in forbidden love. This is where they would come to be alone and share their souls. I ran my finger across the heart shaped etchings on the cobblestones thinking about their conversations, listening for their laughter, picturing them sitting on a blanket under the oak tree sharing an afternoon. It felt as if I was reading the hearts like braille, each with their own memory.\n\nThe hawk titled it\'s head, looking down on Sarah, watching her peer deep into the fountain\'s darkness. \"Don\'t fall in,\" I joked. She looked back at me smiling. The hawk tilted it\'s head back towards, it\'s beady black eyes staring; curious, and I continued sharing my story.  \n\n\"So the story of this place, Sarah,\" I said trying to recapture her attention, \"was shared with me by two widowed elderly women I met at La Dolce Vita last week,\" I said watching her tug on the rope. \"Do you think it\'s odd that this I seat and not a bucket?\" she asked. It was a little unorthodox I thought, but, \"what\'s more strange is how sturdy it appears after all these years,\" I answered. She gave it a strong yank and it didn\'t budge. \"I\'d sit on it,\" she said, obviously distracted but I am hoping she is half listening to me. \"Yeah, why not,\" I replied, \"we may find their hearts.\" She looked across at me, once again interested in my words.\n\nâ€œThey said the story goes like this: Two lovers who believed they were destined to be together; he always compassionately called her an Angel God himself dropped from Heaven, didnâ€™t find one another until each was married and had children. The women said he was a hopeless romantic, poet, followed his heart to a fault and the woman had beautiful, long hair, strands of gold with a nurturing heart. She always around town, tending to her chores as a dutiful wife and was often seen at the edge of a large meadow picnicking with her son under a tall oak tree.â€\n\nâ€œI bet that was the tree,â€ Sarah said pointing through the fountain\'s canopy and across the field to an open space where a creek flowed under a small foot bridge. Itâ€™s large trunk held up the towering, twisted branches with chunks of bark shedding themselves from the cold winter. I looked into excited and happy blue eyes, agreeing with her. \"Tell me more,\" she said connecting our eyes.\n\n\"The townspeople described their presence together as aura of peace surrounding them and that their smiles would turn winter into summer as they walked by,\" Sarah smiled absorbing the nature and peace surrounding her. The hawk screeched as two black jays with white spots landed on the bridge. \"The say flowers bloomed out of nowhere in the middle of winter and treeâ€™s start budding. People thought it was magic because believed that true love could have this kind miraculous power. The couple knew that they couldnâ€™t have this kind of attention shadowing their every step, so this became the place they would meet, secretly away from the town, away from people that knew about them.\"\n\n\"You know,\" Sarah broke in, \"they remind me a little of us,\" she said. \"I wonder if they carved messages to each other on the bridge, like we have?\"\n\nI smiled like she was reading my mind. \"Well, the old ladies\' at the coffee shop said on that bridge is where they would carve messages to each other, \" I chuckled, \"and other times have quiet picnics, speaking intimately without the need for words. Then one afternoon, after six years of meeting secretly the young woman found the courage and strength to change her life.  While they laid together under the Oak she whispered in her lover\'s ear,  *I\'m ready to change my life. Return here in ten days from tomorrow and we will leave this place and finally be together.*\n\nAs she told him, he returned to the bridge ten days later ready run away and begin a new life with her. He waited, and waited. The sun cut through the same winter-sleeping limbs above us and still he waited and waited; waited until the sun fell behind the hill but she never came and he never knew why.\n\nThey say his tears still puddle at the bottom of the fountain and his lost soul still visits the bridge, etching love notes to her soul, hoping she will return to find him in the afterlife.\"\n\nâ€œLets go down and look,â€ she said. \nâ€œLook for what?â€ \nâ€œHis tears.â€\n\nI looked at Sarah mesmerized by the same fairytale and didn\'t think a second time about whether that rope and splintered swing-like seat would hold us because not only it did it not seem to matter. Everything that I mattered was right here in front of me, beautiful, smooth, warm, soft golden strands of hair with a faint luminescence the brightened the grayness of the descending day. I didnâ€™t care if we ever left the damp murkiness of this fountain\'s dirt floor as long as we were together. \n\n\"Come on,\" she said, \"get on\".\nAnd we slowly lowered the seat to bottom.\n\nI watched her look at it. Running her fingers along the archway of stone shaping the top of a heart, the aged wood exterior, cracked and warped and dark like the dirt surrounding it. In the middle, framed like a window, was a painting of a tree; tall with blossoming orange flowers. Despite how old everything was, the painting was in pristine condition. The door wasnâ€™t large, maybe 5 feet tall.\n\nShe knocked. \n\"I guess no oneâ€™s home,\" teasing me with her smile.\n\n\"Look, It\'s another heart,\" she said quietly, \"They really liked hearts I guess.\" \n\"Why are we whispering,\" I asked, holding the heart shaped lock in the palm of my hand. \n\"I donâ€™t know,\" she said, \"I don\'t wake the spirits,\" chuckling, \"don\'t step in her tears,\" pointing to the puddle of water I was standing in. Then raised my chin with her cold finger and kissed me three times whispering â€œI - love - you,â€ between each kiss and placing her hand on my chest, â€œjust you,â€ slipping the skeleton key from around my neck which I had found under the bridge and slipping it into the lockâ€™s heart. \n\nA short click echoed against the fountain\'s walls and the latch fell open. They say everything happens for a reason. That people and the world around us are all connected, synchronized to live in harmony, destiny or whatever it is you believe, and our arriving at this place in this time is exactly where we are supposed to be.\n\n\"Open it,\" I said touching her hand, \"it\'s time to go home.\" Her wedding ring vanished in a poof of purple smoke. A ray of light cast against the ground as the Sarah pulled the door open, as a loud sucking wind chased us from behind. The Hawk screeched above and took off into the sky above with a shrill cry.\n\nHolding hands we tucked our heads under the curved archway and walked into what very well could be our destiny or our greatest mistake.','',1312,'2015-01-23 17:34:42','2015-01-24 14:30:34',0,1,0),

Small granite rocks chipped in the shape of tiny hearts and kicked to the trails edge. Even the clouds looked like hearts. \n\n###3\nâ€œHow did you find this place?â€\nâ€œI bet itâ€™s beautiful when its not so cold and frozen,â€ she said while admiring the cracks and details of the cobblestone fountain, looking lost in a world of enchantment, â€œin fact,â€ she said, â€œwe could have a picnic under that tree by the creek and bridge.â€ Placing her hand on the winter-trapped vine twisting itâ€™s dead looking tenacles not noticing the large hawk swoop towards us from the treetops and perch itself on the canopy; curious.\n\nThe folklore people pass around in these parts is that the fountain and bridge were built back before the beginning of time by a young couple who were trapped in forbidden love. This is where they would come to be alone and share their heart. I ran my finger across the heart shaped etchings on the cobblestones thinking about their conversations, listening for their laughter, picturing them sitting on a blanket under the oak tree sharing an afternoon. It felt as if I was reading the scratched hearts like braille, each with their own memory.\n\nThe hawk tilted itâ€™s head, looking down on Sarah, watching her peer deep into the fountainâ€™s darkness. â€œDonâ€™t fall in,â€ I joked. She looked back at me smiling. The hawk tilted itâ€™s head back towards me, itâ€™s beady black eyes staring; curious, and I continued sharing my story.  \nâ€œSo the story of this place,â€ I said trying to recapture Sarahâ€™s attention, â€œwas shared with me by two widowed elderly women I met at La Dolce Vita last week.â€ I watched Sarah tug on the rope, wondering if she is listening or still lost in her world. \n\nâ€œDo you think itâ€™s odd that this is a seat and not a bucket?â€ she asked. Yes, it was a little unorthodox I thought, but, â€œwhatâ€™s more strange is how sturdy it appears after all these years,â€ I answered. She gave it a strong yank; it appeared solid. â€œIâ€™d sit on it,â€ she said, obviously distracted to asnwer my own previous question. â€œYeah, why not,â€ I went along, â€œwe may find a bunch of pennis down there.â€ She looked across at me, once again interested in my words. â€œFor their wishes,â€ I said looking down with her.\n\nâ€œThey said the story goes like this: There were two lovers who believed they were destined to be together; he always compassionately called her an Angel God himself dropped from Heaven, but they didnâ€™t find one another until each was married and had children. The townspeople said he was a hopeless romantic, poet, followed his heart to a fault and the woman had beautiful, long hair, strands of gold with a nurturing heart. She was always around town, tending to her chores as a dutiful wife and was often seen at the edge of a large meadow picnicking with her son under a tall oak tree.â€\n\nâ€œI bet that was the tree,â€ Sarah said pointing through the fountainâ€™s canopy and across the field to an open space where a creek flowed under a small foot bridge. Itâ€™s large trunk held up the towering, twisted branches with chunks of bark shedding themselves from the cold winter. I looked into her excited and happy smile, agreeing with her. â€œTell me more,â€ she said connecting with my eyes.\n\nâ€œThe townspeople said that when those two were together an aura of peace and happiness surrounded them and that their smiles would turn winter into summer as they walked by like magic.â€ Sarah smiled absorbing the nature and peace surrounding her. The hawk screeched as two black jays with white spots landed on the bridge. â€œThe say flowers bloomed out of nowhere in the middle of winter and treeâ€™s start budding. People who believed as they did, thought it was magic because only true love could have this kind miraculous power. The lovers realized that they couldnâ€™t have this kind of attention shadowing their every step, so they travelled into the woods and this became the place they would meet, secretly away from the town, away from the people that knew about them so they could be who they believed they were meant to be.â€\nâ€œYou know,â€ Sarah broke in, â€œthey remind me a little of us,â€ she said. â€œI wonder if they carved messages to each other on the bridge, like we do?â€\n\nI smiled like she was reading my mind. â€œWell, the old ladiesâ€™ at the coffee shop said the bridge is where they would leave messages to each other,â€  I chuckled, â€œand other times have quiet picnics, speaking intimately without the need for words. Then one afternoon, after six years of meeting secretly the young woman found the courage and strength to want to change her life.  \n\nWhile they laid together under the oak tree she whispered in her loverâ€™s ear,  â€œIâ€™m ready to change my life. Return here in ten days from tomorrow and we will leave this place and finally be together.â€\n\nHe returned to the bridge ten days later ready to run away and begin a new life with her. And he waited, and waited. The sun cut through the same winter-sleeping limbs above us and still he waited and waited until the sun fell behind the hill but she never came and he never knew why.\nThey say his tears still puddle at the bottom of the fountain and his lost soul still visits the bridge, etching love notes to her, hoping she will return to find him.â€\n\nâ€œLets go down and look,â€ she said. \nâ€œLook for what?â€ \nâ€œHis tears.â€\n\nI looked at Sarah mesmerized by the same fairytale and didnâ€™t think a second time about whether that rope and splintered swing would hold us because it didnâ€™t seem to matter. The only thing that I mattered was right here in front of me: beautiful, smooth, warm, soft golden strands of hair with a faint luminescence the brightened the grayness of the descending day. I didnâ€™t care if we ever left the damp murkiness of this fountainâ€™s dirt floor as long as we were together. \n\nâ€œCome on,â€ she said, â€œget onâ€.\n\nAnd we slowly lowered the seat to bottom.  \nI watched her look at it. Running her fingers along the archway of stone shaping the top of a heart, the aged wood exterior, cracked and warped and dark like the dirt leading up to it. In the middle, framed like a window, was a painting of a tree; tall with blossoming orange flowers. Despite how old everything was, the painting was in pristine condition. The door wasnâ€™t large, maybe 5 feet tall.\n\nShe knocked.   \nâ€œI guess no oneâ€™s home,â€ teasing me with a smile.\nâ€œLook, Itâ€™s another heart,â€ she said quietly, â€œThey really liked hearts I guess.â€ \n\nâ€œWhy are we whispering,â€ I asked, holding the heart shaped lock in the palm of my hand. \nâ€œI donâ€™t know,â€ she said, â€œI donâ€™t wake the spirits,â€ chuckling, â€œdonâ€™t step in his tears,â€ pointing to the puddle of water I was standing in. Then raised my chin with her cold finger to her  warm lips, outlined with a light pink gloss, and kissed me three times whispering â€œI - love - you,â€ between each kiss and placing her hand on my chest, â€œjust you,â€ slipping the skeleton key from around my neck which I found under the bridge earlier in the day, and slipped it into the lockâ€™s heart. \n\nA short click echoed against the fountainâ€™s circular wall and the latch fell open. They say everything happens for a reason. That people and the world around us are all connected, synchronized to live in harmony, destiny or whatever it is you believe, and our arriving at this place in this time is exactly where we are supposed to be I thought. \n\nâ€œOpen it,â€ I said touching her hand, â€œitâ€™s time to go home.â€ The wedding ring on her finger vanished in a poof of purple smoke. A ray of light cast against the ground as the Sarah pulled the door open, as a loud sucking wind chased us from behind. The Hawk screeched and flew into the sky above with a shrill cry.\n\nHolding hands we tucked our heads under the curved archway and walked into what very well could be our destiny or our greatest mistake.','',1991,'2015-01-19 12:02:01','2015-01-25 14:12:25',0,1,0),

	(376,136,39,1,29,'Tell Me The Story Again','I grabbed the lapels of her blue peacoat jacket, pulled her close and kissed her. Her lips were warm and soft like her cheeks I held between my hands. \n\nâ€œThis time,â€ I said between another kiss, looking into the blue mystery of her eyes lost in an ocean of dreams, I lovingly whispered, â€œletâ€™s try something different.â€ She smiled, pushing her hair away from her face as the Nevada wind swirled around us, Mount Rose blurred in the background. â€œWe will,â€ kissing me back she said, rolling her hands around the back of my head, through my hair.\nI knew what she meant, I thought. I have heard it before so many times that I didnâ€™t know what to believe any longer. In fact, it was at this exact same spot on this Hill that she wrote in a letter three years earlier. I thought about her declaration of love and feelings for me. The raw vulnerability of her words held close to my heart until the day she lied about everything she had written in those pages. Those words crumpled into a meaningless excuse. It was just a fling she told her husband and everyone her image meant something to.  She excused her passionate words justifying they were crafted by the emotional loss of her child and did not mean what they said. I care for you but I donâ€™t love you she later wrote because people were now watching. \n\nIt was different this time though. Today, there was no fear of consequence or talks about being controlled, or guilted into trying to make her marriage work. She was in a better place this time. I could feel the peace she had finally found in her difficult decision after so many years of struggle, depression and dominance over her life. Her eyes had a courage that I remember the first time looking into them that cool day in Colorado. \n\nHer hands slid down my side, a tender kiss . â€œI and want to leave him.â€\n\nOur connection no longer had to reach through dreams or decipher cryptic messages or hide in the shadows of our disposible emotions anymore. We stood on top the Hill this time unconstrained by the complexities of our fears -free to love at last and scream it from the mountain top if we wanted to or whisper it into each otherâ€™s ear in bed without guilt. This time she meant it.\n\nâ€œLook,â€ she said, pointing to a red-tail hawk circling above our heads, playing in the wind, â€œitâ€™s like everything is right where itâ€™s suppose to be finally,â€ watching the bird glide in circles then swoop down landing on a rock below. â€œIt only took us five years,â€ she said with a small love-me smile. I could see my old smiling face in reflecting in the dilated pupils of eyes from five years earlier.\n\nâ€œThis is where I kissed you last timeâ€, she said, â€œdo you remember?â€ sliding her hands into the front pockets of my jeans like she did the time before.

It was a little unorthodox I thought, but, \"what\'s more strange is how sturdy it appears after all these years,\" I answered. She gave it a strong yank and it didn\'t budge. \"I\'d sit on it,\" she said, obviously distracted but I am hoping she is half listening to me. \"Yeah, why not,\" I replied, \"we may find their hearts.\" She looked across at me, once again interested in my words.\n\nâ€œThey said the story goes like this: Two lovers who believed they were destined to be together; he always compassionately called her an Angel God himself dropped from Heaven, didnâ€™t find one another until each was married and had children. The women said he was a hopeless romantic, poet, followed his heart to a fault and the woman had beautiful, long hair, strands of gold with a nurturing heart. She always around town, tending to her chores as a dutiful wife and was often seen at the edge of a large meadow picnicking with her son under a tall oak tree.â€\n\nâ€œI bet that was the tree,â€ Sarah said pointing through the fountain\'s canopy and across the field to an open space where a creek flowed under a small foot bridge. Itâ€™s large trunk held up the towering, twisted branches with chunks of bark shedding themselves from the cold winter. I looked into excited and happy blue eyes, agreeing with her. \"Tell me more,\" she said connecting our eyes.\n\n\"The townspeople described their presence together as aura of peace surrounding them and that their smiles would turn winter into summer as they walked by,\" Sarah smiled absorbing the nature and peace surrounding her. The hawk screeched as two black jays with white spots landed on the bridge. \"The say flowers bloomed out of nowhere in the middle of winter and treeâ€™s start budding. People thought it was magic because believed that true love could have this kind miraculous power. The couple knew that they couldnâ€™t have this kind of attention shadowing their every step, so this became the place they would meet, secretly away from the town, away from people that knew about them.\"\n\n\"You know,\" Sarah broke in, \"they remind me a little of us,\" she said. \"I wonder if they carved messages to each other on the bridge, like we have?\"\n\nI smiled like she was reading my mind. \"Well, the old ladies\' at the coffee shop said on that bridge is where they would carve messages to each other, \" I chuckled, \"and other times have quiet picnics, speaking intimately without the need for words.

While they laid together under the Oak she whispered in her lover\'s ear,  *I\'m ready to change my life. Return here in ten days from tomorrow and we will leave this place and finally be together.*\n\nAs she told him, he returned to the bridge ten days later ready run away and begin a new life with her. He waited, and waited. The sun cut through the same winter-sleeping limbs above us and still he waited and waited; waited until the sun fell behind the hill but she never came and he never knew why.\n\nThey say his tears still puddle at the bottom of the fountain and his lost soul still visits the bridge, etching love notes to her soul, hoping she will return to find him in the afterlife.\"\n\nâ€œLets go down and look,â€ she said. \nâ€œLook for what?â€ \nâ€œHis tears.â€\n\nI looked at Sarah mesmerized by the same fairytale and didn\'t think a second time about whether that rope and splintered swing-like seat would hold us because not only it did it not seem to matter. Everything that I mattered was right here in front of me, beautiful, smooth, warm, soft golden strands of hair with a faint luminescence the brightened the grayness of the descending day. I didnâ€™t care if we ever left the damp murkiness of this fountain\'s dirt floor as long as we were together. \n\n\"Come on,\" she said, \"get on\".\nAnd we slowly lowered the seat to bottom.\n\nI watched her look at it. Running her fingers along the archway of stone shaping the top of a heart, the aged wood exterior, cracked and warped and dark like the dirt surrounding it. In the middle, framed like a window, was a painting of a tree; tall with blossoming orange flowers. Despite how old everything was, the painting was in pristine condition. The door wasnâ€™t large, maybe 5 feet tall.\n\nShe knocked. \n\"I guess no oneâ€™s home,\" teasing me with her smile.\n\n\"Look, It\'s another heart,\" she said quietly, \"They really liked hearts I guess.\" \n\"Why are we whispering,\" I asked, holding the heart shaped lock in the palm of my hand. \n\"I donâ€™t know,\" she said, \"I don\'t wake the spirits,\" chuckling, \"don\'t step in her tears,\" pointing to the puddle of water I was standing in. Then raised my chin with her cold finger and kissed me three times whispering â€œI - love - you,â€ between each kiss and placing her hand on my chest, â€œjust you,â€ slipping the skeleton key from around my neck which I had found under the bridge and slipping it into the lockâ€™s heart. \n\nA short click echoed against the fountain\'s walls and the latch fell open.

A ray of light cast against the ground as the Sarah pulled the door open, as a loud sucking wind chased us from behind.

	(383,139,42,1,32,'The Dream Walker','\nA stream of guilty thoughts about yesterdayâ€™s dirty lunch date washed over my hands doing tonightâ€™s dishes: rinse and repeat, the monotony reminded me of my marriage. I cook, he eats, I wash, he sleeps, he wakes, we fuck, I sleep and we do it all over again tomorrow. Picking up a plate, circling the sponge in soapy water I once again thought about having that difficult â€œI donâ€™t love you anymoreâ€ conversation with Scott. I have had it inside my head, and heart so many times with myself but always losing my courage. Tonight was no different.\n\nScott was almost asleep in the living room and for a very brief moment I remembered when we did the dishes together, watched tv next to each other on the couch, sometimes falling asleep with my head in his lap. Well, that was almost 11 years ago and things change. I Looked back at him over my shoulder and saw the top of the green pillow  wiggle and his arm flop on top of it. The white noise of dishes and running water in the background was in a way peaceful to us both. We werenâ€™t arguing or having to look at each other with blank feelings for the sake of our son who was eating with us. I looked around and couldnâ€™t see Junior. He must be in his room playing video games with the cat again. It was the perfect time, I thought, the words, Scott we need to talk about things as I pushed his legs aside sitting next to him. They were so close but so afraid of coming out. I lost myself looking out the window, somewhere between where I was and where I wanted to be. \n\nâ€œOh shit,â€ I muttered in a low voice.\nâ€œWhat?â€ Chris mumbled from the couch just about to enter his evening beer-coma. â€œI think I dropped my wedding ring in the sink.â€\n\nLeaning closer into the window, watching a man walk across the street towards the house. He had blue jeans, a black jacket and baseball cap on in. He was unmistakable to me because I just saw Chris yesterday afternoon and drew a white heart on that jacket with a piece of chalk while he looked down into my eyes and told me that he didnâ€™t want me to leave. What is he doing, I asked myself, watching him stop in the middle of the road and stare back at me. I shook my head at him, wet soapy hand on my mouth. His eyes closed and when then opened back up pointing his finger at himself. Then crossed his arms on his chest in an x and pointed a finger at me. I love you he said without words and then disappeared, crossing behind the stop sign on the corner of my front yard. \nI turned off the water and dried my hands. Walking past Scott, I heard his light snoring and noticing his third beer sitting on the coffee table walked lightly to the door, hoping I would get there before the knock or worse the door bell. \n\nI slowed inched the door, a shallow creak in the hinges and watched Chris walk up to me. The screen door separating us. Why are you smiling I thought. â€œWhat are you doing here?â€ I said, â€œyou canâ€™t be here,â€ I told him, looking back towards the living room. â€œItâ€™s dangerous,â€ I whispered through the mesh of the screen, â€œif he wakes up,â€ I paused, pulling the door inside my house closer to me to conceal my voice, â€œif he wakes up and finds you here, he will probably kill you, especially after what you have done.â€\n\nChris stood there smiling at me, â€œWhy are you here?â€ I asked again, â€œplease,â€ I said slightly annoyed and increasingly scared that Scott will wake up any minute now, or Junior will come out looking for one of us. â€œTell me or I am closing this door.â€ \n\nâ€œCome with me,â€ Chris said, holding out his hand. â€œYou told me he abuses you, then leave.â€ My face became blank by his words. â€œItâ€™s not that bad,â€ I replied back and took a deep breath, thinking, I canâ€™t believe this happening, then softly pushed open the front door so it wouldnâ€™t squeak and stood in front of him. I could smell him again and wanted to wrap my arms around him and feel his warm body, run my hands through his short hair, but I couldnâ€™t. The undertow of anger grew inside me and a fear struck me.\n\nâ€œYou know I canâ€™t do that,â€ I answered, â€œnot right now at least,â€ and I put my hand flat on his heart like the day before looking into his eyes with a pleading please, you have to go, but at the same didnâ€™t want him to leave and was secretly walking down the street with him into somewhere else where I was just dreaming. Then I pushed him away, â€œgo.â€ He stepped back taking my arm. I felt his grip not willing to let go. The touch of the black fleece made me remember the day we met at the hotel and I never wanted to leave. I put my hand on his and for the safety of all of us I begged him to leave and I would talk to him tomorrow. â€œHe will kill you,â€ I whispered slowly, fighting back the emotional pull towards him, as he looked into my blue eyes but had no words. â€œPlease,â€ I begged, â€œlet me handle this,â€ kissing him three times; once for every word that I could no longer say out loud: I love you.\n\nI slipped back inside and closed the door. My forehead gently made a thud on the back of the door thinking that I should have went with him; ran out with Junior right then and there and left this bad choice behind, but I canâ€™t just do it. Scott said he would kill him, and me, if I ever I left for him and that he would take everyone I love away from me, including Junior.\nScott slept in his beer nap while I lived in the shadows of his dominance manipulated by fear and coercion.\n\nHe heard a banging in his head like a door knocking and then muffled voices like running water. â€œFine,â€ he said, â€œI will get it,â€ put his beer on the kitchen counter while Christine stared outside washing the dishes like she always does after dinner.\n\nHe opened it and saw him. Dressed in blue jeans, a black jacket and baseball cap. He knew exactly who this intruder of his life was. â€œWhat are you doing here?â€ he asked through the screen door.\nâ€œWhereâ€™s Christine?â€\n\nâ€œGo away,â€ he answered, â€œand donâ€™t come back here again.â€\nHe wasnâ€™t as tall as I thought, maybe 5 foot 6 or 7, wearing an old faded North Face t-shirt in her favorite shade of Navy blue. His hair was a sandy blond like his sons. \n\nâ€œShe told me you abuse her and she wants to leave.â€ \nHis face had a painted expression of anger, anxiety and pride. The memories of her explaining the affair rattled him.\n\nâ€œScott, who is it?â€ Christine asked from the kitchen.  â€œYouâ€™re boyfriend,â€ he replied just before a deafening bang, an metal chime of the shell casing bouncing on the floor.  \n\nâ€œWhat the hell was that,â€ Christine shouted, running to the door. He watched her run through the door, just as we fell to our knees looking at our hands stained red almost in surprise. He watched her lift my head and heard her call my name. Small, rapid footsteps thumped against the new hardwood floors as Junior ran closer, standing next to his dad with holding a gun by his side. \nâ€œMommy, what was that noise?â€ Christine looked back at her son through the screen, â€œgo to your bedroom,â€ she said with a cracking voice. Junior just stood there looking at the blood on her hands, â€œ-now,â€ she yelled and looked back at Scott with fear and anger. â€œYou did what you said you would do. Now take your son to his room and call an ambulance.â€ She turned back to me and wept with anger saying â€œI told you heâ€™d shoot you.â€ She pressed down on the black fleece jack, soaked red, trying to slow the bleeding and looked into his eyes. Through the screen Scott saw her lips moving but couldnâ€™t hear her words, â€œDonâ€™t leave me,â€ she said, â€œI love you and just found you, you impatient idiot.â€\n\nHe took his sonâ€™s hand and disappeared into the delayed sound of someone knocking at the door. He noticed Christine wasnâ€™t at the sink and got off the couch looking for her.\n\nâ€œWho was at the door?â€ I wiped the tears from my eyes and turned around. â€œIt was just a high school kid selling magazines,â€ I answered, â€œand Iâ€™m sorry if our talking woke you up.â€ \n\nHe looked at her with a strange deja-vu confusion and chuckled. â€œYou know I was having the weirdest dream,â€ he said looking into her eyes. â€œYou had an affair and the guy came to the door saying that I abused you and then I shot him and you ran to his side but I couldnâ€™t hear what you were saying to him over the sound of the sirens.â€ \n\nâ€œWell itâ€™s a good thing dreams are only dreams,â€ I answered walking back to the kitchen, â€œand, nothing more.â€\n\nâ€œHey, did you find your ring?,â€ Scott asked from around the corner. I looked at the blue Bud Light Platinum bottle on the coffee table and answered back that Iâ€™ve still got it, slipping it back on my finger, â€œIt didnâ€™t fall too far this time.â€\n\nI stood in front of the sink of cold, soapy water and watched Chris walk away thinking to myself donâ€™t stop trying, one day I will say I do. \n\nThe End','',1665,'2015-01-26 14:36:00','2015-01-26 14:43:17',0,1,0),

Is it a sign that maybe it is time to try something knew or just stop trying to over analyze the situation I thought. They say that the hardest part of change is taking the first step. \n\n\"I\'m sorry James,\" she was saying when my phone vibrated inside my sweatshirt pocket.

And, then walked to my table on the front patio outside where I sat swirling the remaining, cold, black tea.\n\nShe watched me gulp down the last of the drops and whispered to herself,  \"I know you will,\" hanging up her apron for the day and walking the cup of tea outside to me on her way home.\n \n\"What are you reading?\" she asked sitting across the table, running her hand through her straight, blonde hair that hung just below her shoulders with a solemn expression; twisting the end with her fingers.\n\n\"This month\'s issue of [__8149__](http://eightyonefortynine.com/),\" I answered watching her wrap her hands around the warm cup. \"It\'s a magazine for the hopeless romantic\" I explained, \"I have a short fictional piece about forbidden love published in this issue.\" \n\nShe looked me with through her Michael Kors frames with that flirty, alluring smile and asked, \"Look into my eyes and tell me what you see?\" I noticed she put on a light pink lipstick since helping me inside.

	(389,122,36,1,1,'Writing a RESTful API in PHP Part 1','It\'s not everyday you wake up and thinking you\'re going to spend it coding a RESTful API, but it was a cold, rainy day here Sacramento so why I thought why not plug in the [Jaybird BludBuds X](http://bit.ly/1y99BFA) headphone\'s for a battery life test and begin my own personal hackathon. \n\nLets start with the basics. What is a RESTful API and why would I even want to invest a day or my writing one. REST is an acronym for [Representational State Transfer](http://bit.ly/15zbqlC) (REST) and is a software architecture style consisting of guidelines and best practices for creating scalable web services. An API  is yet another acronym in the programming world standing for: [Application Programming Interface] (http://bit.ly/15zcjL1) [source: wikipedia]. A basic use of a RESTful API would be to share content (or data) between online communities and other programs, typically in the usage of a URI like http://api.[domain].com/v1/user/get/23 which returns the result in either XML or JSON formats.\n\nMy need for an RESTful API is for another one of my web assets, [Page126](http://page126.com). I want to be able to share a piece of content created on Page126 with another one of my web assets [No More Black Tea](http://nomoreblacktea.com). Although they are on the same shared server, I could simply fetch the database row from the other domain and share it internally through the PHP code, but what fun is that? Plus it\'s still raining outside, and a RESTful API would let other users not on the same server be able to share what they write in Page126 as well. \n\nSo, my goal in the first release of this simple RESTful API written in PHP, and titled, [pedicabAPI](http://bit.ly/1CBF4AK) is to create the high-level architecture (or skeleton model) of the API. Functionally, this version of the API will allow only allow for cross-origin connections and include 1 method, the GET verb -for starters because it\'s all I really need right now. [You can download the source at Github if you want.](http://bit.ly/1CBF4AK). Verbs are basically the jargon that the server and browser  use to pass information back and forth. You only really use the word \"verb\" to describe the method, in which case for semantic purposes I also called the actionable variable in the code $verb.\n\nBefore I got to typing a lick of code I chicken scratched some pseudo code determining what my short term and long term needs would be and then decided on a simple but scalable file structure (see image below). The first thing I hope you noticed is how versions of the API have been separated into subdirectories, and each verb associated with the API has it\'s own model. In my head, this just helps visually organize your programming logic. It\'s basically MVC with the View being the API response in either XML or JSON which is returned by the controller, in this case, API.php.\n\nLets take a quick birds-eye-view of the code and then if you\'re like me, you will want to just dive into it and make it your own. This is why I [posted it on Github](http://bit.ly/1CBF4AK) so please fork it if you wish. \n\n__.htaccess__  \nWe start things off with a quick URL rewrite using Apache\'s .htaccess. This lets you use clean URI\'s like http:://[domain]/[version]/[endpoint]/[verb]/[id] without the query string or ? and & symbols you may see on other website URLs. I think the easiest way to explain this is to look at it. \n\n     <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\n     RewriteEngine On\n\n     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !(/$|\\.) \n     RewriteRule (.*) %{REQUEST_URI}/ [R=301,L] \n\n     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\n     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\n     RewriteRule (.*)/(.*)/(.*)/(.*)/$ v1/index.php?version=$1&endpoint=$2&verb=$3&id=$4 [QSA,NC,L]\n     </IfModule>\n\nThe foreign parts of this are probably the (.*)/ which are simply placeholders for segments of the URL which when the placeholders (eg., the $1, $2, $3 and $4) are then substituted in the same order.\n\n__The bootloader__ - index.php   \nAll this file basically does is startup the API by creating the API object and then serving as a simple traffic cop, routing things to the correct models and methods as requested by the API URI. Nothing fancy really.\n\n__The Controller__ - API.php  \nThis is the core of the process and includes methods that will be inherited by the other models, which I will refer to as the endpoints. The controller will segment the API\'s URI, establish the database connection as well as be used to assign response codes and then return the HTTP/1.1 header with result from the endpoint. At which point the program ends. \n\nIn the next version I will add authentication options for things such as a users login/password and most importantly an API key, as well a private API Key for PUT/POST/DELETE methods. This however would have required new code functionality on Page126 and why for the mean time I didn\'t include it. But, if you would like to contribute to this project and help in development just let me know.\n\n__The Models (or endpoints)__ - pages.php, user.php, etc.  \nHere is where most of the magic happens. I organized my models to match my endpoints. This way as the number endpoint options grew the file wouldn\'t be unmanageable. For example, currently the pages.php model only has 1 method (getPageById) for fetching a single row from the database. Maybe in the future I would like to add a comment to a page via a mobile app. I just add another method (addPageComment), or I want to retrieve all comments for a specific page (getPageCommentsApproved). Any method that is added to this endpoint model only interfaces with database tables relating to Pages. It\'s also worth noting that I am currently not preparing my database queries and then executing. So because of that I scrub the ID received from API URL using the mysqli_real_escape_string  function which will at least escape out special characters to help prevent sql injection. The last thing that this endpoint model will do is request the response the code from the API controller (200 for success and maybe 404 Not Found) and then encode the results in JSON.\n\nYou create as many endpoint methods as you need and bootstrap (index.php) will route them dynamically through the correct verb methods. The only thing you may have to watch is if you change the number of parameters in the API URI. This will effect the mod_rewrite rules in the .htaccess file. \n\n__Okay, now I how to use it__  \nYou will need to use an AJAX request with javascript or PHPs file_get_contents function. Then, format the returned JSON result with HTML/CSS.\n\nFor my implementation on nomoreblacktea.com I used the [Parsedown library for PHP](http://bit.ly/1L0Yzc8) by [Emanuil Rusev](http://erusev.com). \n\n     <article id=\"content\">\n     <?php\n      \n          include(\'lib/Parsedown.php\');\n          include(\'lib/ParsedownExtra.php\');\n          $Parsedown = new Parsedown();\n\n          $api_result = file_get_contents(\'http://api.page126.com/v1/page/get/123/\');\n          $bodycontent = json_decode($api_result);\n          echo $Parsedown->text($bodycontent->{\'content\'});\n\n      ?>\n      </article>\n\nThat\'s it! You can see the above live [here](http://nomoreblacktea.com).\n\nWell look at that the sun is finally out for the first in a week!  \nTime to close the laptop and hit the bike trail finally.\n\nHappy API\'ng!','',1144,'2015-01-18 23:09:16','2015-01-22 19:40:42',0,1,0),

I ran my finger across the heart shaped etchings on the cobblestones thinking about their conversations, listening for their laughter, picturing them sitting on a blanket under the oak tree sharing an afternoon. It felt as if I was reading the hearts like braille, each with their own memory.\n\nThe hawk titled it\'s head, looking down on Sarah, watching her peer deep into the fountain\'s darkness. \"Don\'t fall in,\" I joked. She looked back at me smiling. The hawk tilted it\'s head back towards, it\'s beady black eyes staring; curious, and I continued sharing my story.  \n\n\"So the story of this place, Sarah,\" I said trying to recapture her attention, \"was shared with me by two widowed elderly women I met at La Dolce Vita last week,\" I said watching her tug on the rope. \"Do you think it\'s odd that this I seat and not a bucket?\" she asked. It was a little unorthodox I thought, but, \"what\'s more strange is how sturdy it appears after all these years,\" I answered. She gave it a strong yank and it didn\'t budge. \"I\'d sit on it,\" she said, obviously distracted but I am hoping she is half listening to me. \"Yeah, why not,\" I replied, \"we may find their hearts.\" She looked across at me, once again interested in my words.\n\n\"They said the story goes like this: Two lovers who believed they were destined to be together; he always compassionately called her an Angel God himself dropped from Heaven, didn\'t find one another until each was married and had children. The women said he was a hopeless romantic, poet, followed his heart to a fault and the woman had beautiful, long hair, strands of gold with a nurturing heart. She always around town, tending to her chores as a dutiful wife and was often seen at the edge of a large meadow picnicking with her son under a tall oak tree.\"\n\n\"I bet that was the tree,\" Sarah said pointing through the fountain\'s canopy and across the field to an open space where a creek flowed under a small foot bridge. It\'s large trunk held up the towering, twisted branches with chunks of bark shedding themselves from the cold winter. I looked into excited and happy blue eyes, agreeing with her. \"Tell me more,\" she said connecting our eyes.\n\n\"The townspeople described their presence together as aura of peace surrounding them and that their smiles would turn winter into summer as they walked by,\" Sarah smiled absorbing the nature and peace surrounding her. The hawk screeched as two black jays with white spots landed on the bridge. \"The say flowers bloomed out of nowhere in the middle of winter and tree\'s start budding. People thought it was magic because believed that true love could have this kind miraculous power. The couple knew that they couldn\'t have this kind of attention shadowing their every step, so this became the place they would meet, secretly away from the town, away from people that knew about them.\"\n\n\"You know,\" Sarah broke in, \"they remind me a little of us,\" she said. \"I wonder if they carved messages to each other on the bridge, like we have?\"\n\nI smiled like she was reading my mind. \"Well, the old ladies\' at the coffee shop said on that bridge is where they would carve messages to each other, \" I chuckled, \"and other times have quiet picnics, speaking intimately without the need for words. Then one afternoon, after six years of meeting secretly the young woman found the courage and strength to change her life.  While they laid together under the Oak she whispered in her lover\'s ear,  *I\'m ready to change my life. Return here in ten days from tomorrow and we will leave this place and finally be together.*\n\nAs she told him, he returned to the bridge ten days later ready run away and begin a new life with her. He waited, and waited. The sun cut through the same winter-sleeping limbs above us and still he waited and waited; waited until the sun fell behind the hill but she never came and he never knew why.\n\nThey say his tears still puddle at the bottom of the fountain and his lost soul still visits the bridge, etching love notes to her soul, hoping she will return to find him in the afterlife.\"\n\n\"Lets go down and look,\" she said. \n\"Look for what?\" \n\"His tears.\"\n\nI looked at Sarah mesmerized by the same fairytale and didn\'t think a second time about whether that rope and splintered swing-like seat would hold us because not only it did it not seem to matter. Everything that I mattered was right here in front of me, beautiful, smooth, warm, soft golden strands of hair with a faint luminescence the brightened the grayness of the descending day. I didn\'t care if we ever left the damp murkiness of this fountain\'s dirt floor as long as we were together. \n\n\"Come on,\" she said, \"get on\".\nAnd we slowly lowered the seat to bottom.\n\nI watched her look at it. Running her fingers along the archway of stone shaping the top of a heart, the aged wood exterior, cracked and warped and dark like the dirt surrounding it. In the middle, framed like a window, was a painting of a tree; tall with blossoming orange flowers. Despite how old everything was, the painting was in pristine condition. The door wasn\'t large, maybe 5 feet tall.\n\nShe knocked. \n\"I guess no one\'s home,\" teasing me with her smile.\n\n\"Look, It\'s another heart,\" she said quietly, \"They really liked hearts I guess.\" \n\"Why are we whispering,\" I asked, holding the heart shaped lock in the palm of my hand. \n\"I don\'t know,\" she said, \"I don\'t wake the spirits,\" chuckling, \"don\'t step in her tears,\" pointing to the puddle of water I was standing in. Then raised my chin with her cold finger and kissed me three times whispering \"I - love - you,\" between each kiss and placing her hand on my chest, \"just you,\" slipping the skeleton key from around my neck which I had found under the bridge and slipping it into the lock\'s heart. \n\nA short click echoed against the fountain\'s walls and the latch fell open. They say everything happens for a reason. That people and the world around us are all connected, synchronized to live in harmony, destiny or whatever it is you believe, and our arriving at this place in this time is exactly where we are supposed to be.\n\n\"Open it,\" I said touching her hand, \"it\'s time to go home.\" Her wedding ring vanished in a poof of purple smoke. A ray of light cast against the ground as the Sarah pulled the door open, as a loud sucking wind chased us from behind. The Hawk screeched above and took off into the sky above with a shrill cry.\n\nHolding hands we tucked our heads under the curved archway and walked into what very well could be our destiny or our greatest mistake.','',1312,'2015-01-23 17:34:42','2015-01-26 20:09:27',0,1,0),

The only thing that I mattered was right here in front of me: beautiful, smooth, warm, soft golden strands of hair with a faint luminescence the brightened the grayness of the descending day. I didn\'t care if we ever left the damp murkiness of this fountain\'s dirt floor as long as we were together. \n\n\"Come on,\" she said, \"get on\".\n\nAnd we slowly lowered the seat to bottom.  \nI watched her look at it. Running her fingers along the archway of stone shaping the top of a heart, the aged wood exterior, cracked and warped and dark like the dirt leading up to it. In the middle, framed like a window, was a painting of a tree; tall with blossoming orange flowers. Despite how old everything was, the painting was in pristine condition. The door wasn\'t large, maybe 5 feet tall.\n\nShe knocked.   \n\"I guess no one\'s home,\" teasing me with a smile.\n\"Look, It\'s another heart,\" she said quietly, \"They really liked hearts I guess.\" \n\n\"Why are we whispering,\" I asked, holding the heart shaped lock in the palm of my hand. \n\"I don\'t know,\" she said, \"I don\'t wake the spirits,\" chuckling, \"don\'t step in his tears,\" pointing to the puddle of water I was standing in. Then raised my chin with her cold finger to her  warm lips, outlined with a light pink gloss, and kissed me three times whispering \"I - love - you,\" between each kiss and placing her hand on my chest, \"just you,\" slipping the skeleton key from around my neck which I found under the bridge earlier in the day, and slipped it into the lock\'s heart. \n\nA short click echoed against the fountain\'s circular wall and the latch fell open. They say everything happens for a reason. That people and the world around us are all connected, synchronized to live in harmony, destiny or whatever it is you believe, and our arriving at this place in this time is exactly where we are supposed to be I thought. \n\n\"Open it,\" I said touching her hand, \"it\'s time to go home.\" The wedding ring on her finger vanished in a poof of purple smoke. A ray of light cast against the ground as she pulled the door open, as a loud sucking wind chased us from behind. The Hawk screeched and flew into the sky above with a shrill cry.\n\nHolding hands we ducked our heads under the curved archway and walked into what very well could be our destiny or our greatest mistake.\n\n###3  \n__\"SO WHAT DID THEY WALK INTO,\" SHE ASKED, TAKING A SIP OF HER TEA.__  I looked into her blue eyes that were not willing to take no for an answer.\n\n\"Their future.\"','',1956,'2015-01-19 12:02:01','2015-01-26 20:19:38',0,1,0),

And, then walked to my table on the front patio outside where I sat swirling the remaining, cold, black tea.\n\nShe watched me gulp down the last of the drops and whispered to herself,  \"I know you will,\" hanging up her apron for the day and walking the cup of tea outside to me on her way home.\n \n\"What are you reading?\" she asked sitting across the table, running her hand through her straight, blonde hair that hung just below her shoulders with a solemn expression; twisting the end with her fingers.\n\n\"This month\'s issue of [__8149__](http://eightyonefortynine.com/),\" I answered watching her wrap her hands around the warm cup. \"It\'s a magazine for the hopeless romantic\" I explained, \"I have a short fictional piece about forbidden love published in this issue.\" \n\nShe looked me with through her Michael Kors frames with that flirty, alluring smile and asked, \"Look into my eyes and tell me what you see?\" I noticed she put on a light pink lipstick since helping me inside.

This is where they would come to be alone and share their heart. I ran my finger across the heart shaped etchings on the cobblestones thinking about their conversations, listening for their laughter, picturing them sitting on a blanket under the oak tree sharing an afternoon. It felt as if I was reading the scratched hearts like braille, each with their own memory.\n\nThe hawk tilted it\'s head, looking down on her, watching her peer deep into the fountain\'s darkness. \"Don\'t fall in,\" I joked. She looked back at me smiling. The hawk tilted it\'s head back towards me, it\'s beady black eyes staring; curious, and I continued sharing my story.  \n\n\"So the story of this place,\" I said trying to recapture her attention, \"was shared with me by two widowed elderly women I met at La Dolce Vita last week.\" I watched her tug on the rope, wondering if she is listening or still lost in her world. \n\n\"Do you think it\'s odd that this is a seat and not a bucket?\" she asked. Yes, it was a little unorthodox I thought, but, \"what\'s more strange is how sturdy it appears after all these years,\" I answered. She gave it a strong yank; it appeared solid. \"I\'d sit on it,\" she said, obviously distracted to answer my own previous question. \"Yeah, why not,\" I went along, \"we may find a bunch of pennies down there.\" She looked across at me, once again interested in my words. \"For their wishes,\" I said looking down with her.\n\n\"They said the story goes like this: There were two lovers who believed they were destined to be together; he always compassionately called her an Angel God himself dropped from Heaven, but they didn\'t find one another until each was married and had children. The townspeople said he was a hopeless romantic, poet, followed his heart to a fault and the woman had beautiful, long hair, strands of gold with a nurturing heart. She was always around town, tending to her chores as a dutiful wife and was often seen at the edge of a large meadow picnicking with her son under a tall oak tree.\"\n\n\"I bet that was the tree,\" She said pointing through the fountain\'s canopy and across the field to an open space where a creek flowed under a small foot bridge. It\'s large trunk held up the towering, twisted branches with chunks of bark shedding themselves from the cold winter. I looked into her excited and happy smile, agreeing with her. \"Tell me more,\" she said connecting with my eyes.\n\n\"The townspeople said that when those two were together an aura of peace and happiness surrounded them and that their smiles would turn winter into summer as they walked by like magic.\" She smiled absorbing the nature and peace surrounding her. The hawk screeched as two black jays with white spots landed on the bridge. \"The say flowers bloomed out of nowhere in the middle of winter and tree\'s start budding. People who believed as they did, thought it was magic because only true love could have this kind miraculous power. The lovers realized that they couldn\'t have this kind of attention shadowing their every step, so they travelled into the woods and this became the place they would meet, secretly away from the town, away from the people that knew about them so they could be who they believed they were meant to be.\"\n\n\"You know,\" She broke in, \"they remind me a little of us,\" she said. \"I wonder if they carved messages to each other on the bridge, like we do?\"\n\nI smiled like she was reading my mind. \"Well, the old ladies\' at the coffee shop said the bridge is where they would leave messages to each other,\"  I chuckled, \"and other times have quiet picnics, speaking intimately without the need for words. Then one afternoon, after six years of meeting secretly the young woman found the courage and strength to want to change her life.  \n\nWhile they laid together under the oak tree she whispered in her lover\'s ear,  \"I\'m ready to change my life.

Then raised my chin with her cold finger to her  warm lips, outlined with a light pink gloss, and kissed me three times whispering \"I - love - you,\" between each kiss and placing her hand on my chest, \"just you,\" slipping the skeleton key from around my neck which I found under the bridge earlier in the day, and slipped it into the lock\'s heart. \n\nA short click echoed against the fountain\'s circular wall and the latch fell open.

	(398,123,2,1,1,'No More Black Tea','###1\n__LOOKING INTO MY WHITE CUP I NOTICED, NO MORE BLACK TEA__. So I walked up to the counter, a mosaic of broken ceramic tile creating a pinkish, blue and yellow sunset setting behind whitecap mountains and I asked the barista for another bag of Earl Grey.  She looked at me with a small smile apologizing that they were unfortunately out of tea.\n\n\"How can a coffee and tea shop be out of tea?\" I chuckled, \"Well, it\'s not that we are out of all tea,\"  she explained with her cute, persuasive smile, \"we still have Green Tea and White Tea with Pomegranate that I promise are just as good.\" I smiled back at her thinking that *I have been coming here every Tuesday for the last five years and they have never been out of black tea.*  And, while I pondered the meaning of it, she offered to check in the back. Is it a sign that maybe it is time to try something knew or just stop trying to over analyze the situation I thought. They say that the hardest part of change is taking the first step. \n\n\"I\'m sorry James,\" she was saying when my phone vibrated inside my sweatshirt pocket. I peeked at the screen with hesitation and flipped the screen over, reading the message and hearing her voice faintly in the background finish saying that she couldn\'t find any more.\n\n<span style=\"margin-left: 40px\">*I can\'t be be who you want me to be, but I will always love you*</span>  --the text read. \n\n*Did I just say that out loud.* By the look the on her face I would say I did. Quickly I disguised my disappointment and pain mumbling about how green tea isn\'t the same but I would I try a cup; the one with pomegranate. And, then walked to my table on the front patio outside where I sat swirling the remaining, cold, black tea.\n\nShe watched me gulp down the last of the drops and whispered to herself,  \"I know you will,\" hanging up her apron for the day and walking the cup of tea outside to me on her way home.\n \n\"What are you reading?\" she asked sitting across the table, running her hand through her straight, blonde hair that hung just below her shoulders with a solemn expression; twisting the end with her fingers.\n\n\"This month\'s issue of [__8149__](http://eightyonefortynine.com/),\" I answered watching her wrap her hands around the warm cup. \"It\'s a magazine for the hopeless romantic\" I explained, \"I have a short fictional piece about forbidden love published in this issue.\" \n\nShe looked me with through her Michael Kors frames with that flirty, alluring smile and asked, \"Look into my eyes and tell me what you see?\" I noticed she put on a light pink lipstick since helping me inside. It looked nice on her lips. A light breeze passed by us teasing my senses with her perfume. \n\n\"I see a married woman,\" I answered looking at her hands.\n\nShe slid off her platinum and blue sapphire wedding band and looked at me again, this time with a deep stare that reached inside me, cradling my heart, while her foot traced up the outside of my leg under the table, and replied, \"try now.\"  \n\n###2  \n__\"HOW DID YOU FIND THIS PLACE?\" SHE ASKED LOOKING AROUND THE WOODS. __ \"I bet it\'s beautiful when its not so cold and frozen,\" admiring the details of the cobblestone fountain, looking lost in a world of enchantment, \"in fact,\" she said, \"we could have a picnic under that tree by the creek and bridge.\" Placing her hand on the winter-trapped vine twisting it\'s dead looking tentacles not noticing the large hawk swoop towards us from the treetops and perch itself on the canopy; curious.\n\nThe folklore people pass around in these parts is that the fountain and bridge were built back before the beginning of time by a young couple who were trapped in forbidden love. This is where they would come to be alone and share their heart. I ran my finger across the heart shaped etchings on the cobblestones thinking about their conversations, listening for their laughter, picturing them sitting on a blanket under the oak tree sharing an afternoon. It felt as if I was reading the scratched hearts like braille, each with their own memory.\n\nThe hawk tilted it\'s head, looking down on her, watching her peer deep into the fountain\'s darkness. \"Don\'t fall in,\" I joked. She looked back at me smiling. The hawk tilted it\'s head back towards me, it\'s beady black eyes staring; curious, and I continued sharing my story.  \n\n\"So the story of this place,\" I said trying to recapture her attention, \"was shared with me by two widowed elderly women I met at La Dolce Vita last week.\" I watched her tug on the rope, wondering if she is listening or still lost in her world. \n\n\"Do you think it\'s odd that this is a seat and not a bucket?\" she asked. Yes, it was a little unorthodox I thought, but, \"what\'s more strange is how sturdy it appears after all these years,\" I answered. She gave it a strong yank; it appeared solid. \"I\'d sit on it,\" she said, obviously distracted to answer my own previous question. \"Yeah, why not,\" I went along, \"we may find a bunch of pennies down there.\" She looked across at me, once again interested in my words. \"For their wishes,\" I said looking down with her.\n\n\"They said the story goes like this: There were two lovers who believed they were destined to be together; he always compassionately called her an Angel God himself dropped from Heaven, but they didn\'t find one another until each was married and had children. The townspeople said he was a hopeless romantic, poet, followed his heart to a fault and the woman had beautiful, long hair, strands of gold with a nurturing heart. She was always around town, tending to her chores as a dutiful wife and was often seen at the edge of a large meadow picnicking with her son under a tall oak tree.\"\n\n\"I bet that was the tree,\" She said pointing through the fountain\'s canopy and across the field to an open space where a creek flowed under a small foot bridge. It\'s large trunk held up the towering, twisted branches with chunks of bark shedding themselves from the cold winter. I looked into her excited and happy smile, agreeing with her. \"Tell me more,\" she said connecting with my eyes.\n\n\"The townspeople said that when those two were together an aura of peace and happiness surrounded them and that their smiles would turn winter into summer as they walked by like magic.\" She smiled absorbing the nature and peace surrounding her. The hawk screeched as two black jays with white spots landed on the bridge. \"The say flowers bloomed out of nowhere in the middle of winter and tree\'s start budding. People who believed as they did, thought it was magic because only true love could have this kind miraculous power.

The women said he was a hopeless romantic, poet, followed his heart to a fault and the woman had beautiful, long hair, strands of gold with a nurturing heart. She always around town, tending to her chores as a dutiful wife and was often seen at the edge of a large meadow picnicking with her son under a tall oak tree.\"\n\n\"I bet that was the tree,\" Sarah said pointing through the fountain\'s canopy and across the field to an open space where a creek flowed under a small foot bridge. It\'s large trunk held up the towering, twisted branches with chunks of bark shedding themselves from the cold winter. I looked into excited and happy blue eyes, agreeing with her. \"Tell me more,\" she said connecting our eyes.\n\n\"The townspeople described their presence together as aura of peace surrounding them and that their smiles would turn winter into summer as they walked by,\" Sarah smiled absorbing the nature and peace surrounding her.

Then raised my chin with her cold finger and kissed me three times whispering \"I - love - you,\" between each kiss and placing her hand on my chest, \"just you,\" slipping the skeleton key from around my neck which I had found under the bridge and slipping it into the lock\'s heart. \n\nA short click echoed against the fountain\'s walls and the latch fell open.

Return here in ten days from tomorrow and we will leave this place and finally be together.\"\n\nHe returned to the bridge ten days later ready to run away and begin a new life with her. And he waited, and waited. The sun cut through the same winter-sleeping limbs above us and still he waited and waited until the sun fell behind the hill but she never came and he never knew why.\nThey say his tears still puddle at the bottom of the fountain and his lost soul still visits the bridge, etching love notes to her, hoping she will return to find him.\"\n\n\"Lets go down and look,\" she said. \n\"Look for what?\" \n\"His tears.\"\n\nI looked at her mesmerized by the same fairytale and didn\'t think a second time about whether that rope and splintered swing would hold us because it didn\'t seem to matter. The only thing that I mattered was right here in front of me: beautiful, smooth, warm, soft golden strands of hair with a faint luminescence the brightened the grayness of the descending day. I didn\'t care if we ever left the damp murkiness of this fountain\'s dirt floor as long as we were together. \n\n\"Come on,\" she said, \"get on\".\n\nAnd we slowly lowered the seat to bottom.  \nI watched her look at it. Running her fingers along the archway of stone shaping the top of a heart, the aged wood exterior, cracked and warped and dark like the dirt leading up to it. In the middle, framed like a window, was a painting of a tree; tall with blossoming orange flowers. Despite how old everything was, the painting was in pristine condition. The door wasn\'t large, maybe 5 feet tall.\n\nShe knocked.   \n\"I guess no one\'s home,\" teasing me with a smile.\n\"Look, It\'s another heart,\" she said quietly, \"They really liked hearts I guess.\" \n\n\"Why are we whispering,\" I asked, holding the heart shaped lock in the palm of my hand. \n\"I don\'t know,\" she said, \"I don\'t wake the spirits,\" chuckling, \"don\'t step in his tears,\" pointing to the puddle of water I was standing in. Then raised my chin with her cold finger to her  warm lips, outlined with a light pink gloss, and kissed me three times whispering \"I - love - you,\" between each kiss and placing her hand on my chest, \"just you,\" slipping the skeleton key from around my neck which I found under the bridge earlier in the day, and slipped it into the lock\'s heart. \n\nA short click echoed against the fountain\'s circular wall and the latch fell open. They say everything happens for a reason. That people and the world around us are all connected, synchronized to live in harmony, destiny or whatever it is you believe, and our arriving at this place in this time is exactly where we are supposed to be I thought. \n\n\"Open it,\" I said touching her hand, \"it\'s time to go home.\" The wedding ring on her finger vanished in a poof of purple smoke. A ray of light cast against the ground as she pulled the door open, as a loud sucking wind chased us from behind. The Hawk screeched and flew into the sky above with a shrill cry.\n\nHolding hands we ducked our heads under the curved archway and walked into what very well could be our destiny or our greatest mistake.\n\n###3  \n__\"SO WHAT DID THEY WALK INTO,\" SHE ASKED, TAKING A SIP OF HER TEA.__  I looked into her blue eyes that were not willing to take no for an answer.\n\n\"A glimpse of their future.\"','',1959,'2015-01-19 12:02:01','2015-01-27 17:43:45',0,1,0),

And, then walked to my table on the front patio outside where I sat swirling the remaining, cold, black tea.\n\nShe watched me gulp down the last of the drops and whispered to herself,  \"I know you will,\" hanging up her apron for the day and walking the cup of tea outside to me on her way home.\n \n\"What are you reading?\" she asked sitting across the table, running her hand through her straight, blonde hair that hung just below her shoulders with a solemn expression; twisting the end with her fingers.\n\n\"This month\'s issue of [__8149__](http://eightyonefortynine.com/),\" I answered watching her wrap her hands around the warm cup. \"It\'s a magazine for the hopeless romantic\" I explained, \"I have a short fictional piece about forbidden love published in this issue.\" \n\nShe looked me with through her Michael Kors frames with that flirty, alluring smile and asked, \"Look into my eyes and tell me what you see?\" I noticed she put on a light pink lipstick since helping me inside.

She looked back at me smiling. The hawk tilted it\'s head back towards me, it\'s beady black eyes staring; curious, and I continued sharing my story.  \n\n\"So the story of this place,\" I said trying to recapture her attention, \"was shared with me by two widowed elderly women I met at La Dolce Vita last week.\" I watched her tug on the rope, wondering if she is listening or still lost in her world. \n\n\"Do you think it\'s odd that this is a seat and not a bucket?\" she asked. Yes, it was a little unorthodox I thought, but, \"what\'s more strange is how sturdy it appears after all these years,\" I answered. She gave it a strong yank; it appeared solid. \"I\'d sit on it,\" she said, obviously distracted to answer my own previous question. \"Yeah, why not,\" I went along, \"we may find a bunch of pennies down there.\" She looked across at me, once again interested in my words. \"For their wishes,\" I said looking down with her.\n\n\"They said the story goes like this: There were two lovers who believed they were destined to be together; he always compassionately called her an Angel God himself dropped from Heaven, but they didn\'t find one another until each was married and had children. The townspeople said he was a hopeless romantic, poet, followed his heart to a fault and the woman had beautiful, long hair, strands of gold with a nurturing heart. She was always around town, tending to her chores as a dutiful wife and was often seen at the edge of a large meadow picnicking with her son under a tall oak tree.\"\n\n\"I bet that was the tree,\" She said pointing through the fountain\'s canopy and across the field to an open space where a creek flowed under a small foot bridge. It\'s large trunk held up the towering, twisted branches with chunks of bark shedding themselves from the cold winter. I looked into her excited and happy smile, agreeing with her. \"Tell me more,\" she said connecting with my eyes.\n\n\"The townspeople said that when those two were together an aura of peace and happiness surrounded them and that their smiles would turn winter into summer as they walked by like magic.\" She smiled absorbing the nature and peace surrounding her.

Yes, it was a little unorthodox I thought, but, \"what\'s more strange is how sturdy it appears after all these years,\" I answered.

The townspeople said he was a hopeless romantic, poet, followed his heart to a fault and the woman had beautiful, long hair, strands of gold with a nurturing heart. She was always around town, tending to her chores as a dutiful wife and was often seen at the edge of a large meadow picnicking with her son under a tall oak tree.\"\n\n\"I bet that was the tree,\" She said pointing through the fountain\'s canopy and across the field to an open space where a creek flowed under a small foot bridge. It\'s large trunk held up the towering, twisted branches with chunks of bark shedding themselves from the cold winter. I looked into her excited and happy smile, agreeing with her. \"Tell me more,\" she said connecting with my eyes.\n\n\"The townspeople said that when those two were together an aura of peace and happiness surrounded them and that their smiles would turn winter into summer as they walked by like magic.\" She smiled absorbing the nature and peace surrounding her.

People who believed as they did, thought it was magic because only true love could have this kind miraculous power.

Running her fingers along the archway of stone shaping the top of a heart, the aged wood exterior, cracked and warped and dark like the dirt leading up to it. In the middle, framed like a window, was a painting of a tree; tall with blossoming orange flowers. Despite how old everything was, the painting was in pristine condition. The door wasn\'t large, maybe 5 feet tall.\n\nShe knocked.   \n\"I guess no one\'s home,\" teasing me with a smile.\n\"Look, It\'s another heart,\" she said quietly, \"They really liked hearts I guess.\" \n\n\"Why are we whispering,\" I asked, holding the heart shaped lock in the palm of my hand. \n\"I don\'t know,\" she said, \"I don\'t wake the spirits,\" chuckling, \"don\'t step in his tears,\" pointing to the puddle of water I was standing in. Then raised my chin with her cold finger to her  warm lips, outlined with a light pink gloss, and kissed me three times whispering \"I - love - you,\" between each kiss and placing her hand on my chest, \"just you,\" slipping the skeleton key from around my neck which I found under the bridge earlier in the day, and slipped it into the lock\'s heart. \n\nA short click echoed against the fountain\'s circular wall and the latch fell open. They say everything happens for a reason.

A ray of light cast against the ground as she pulled the door open, as a loud sucking wind chased us from behind.

Then raised my chin with her cold finger to her  warm lips, outlined with a light pink gloss, and kissed me three times whispering \"I - love - you,\" between each kiss and placing her hand on my chest, \"just you,\" slipping the skeleton key from around my neck which I found under the bridge earlier in the day, and slipped it into the lock\'s heart. \n\nA short click echoed against the fountain\'s circular wall and the latch fell open.

Then raised my chin with her cold finger to her  warm lips, outlined with a light pink gloss, and kissed me three times whispering \"I - love - you,\" between each kiss and placing her hand on my chest, \"just you,\" slipping the skeleton key from around my neck which I found under the bridge earlier in the day, and slipped it into the lock\'s heart. \n\nA short click echoed against the fountain\'s circular wall and the latch fell open.

The sun cut through the same winter-sleeping limbs above us and still he waited and waited until the sun fell behind the hill but she never came and he never knew why.\nThey say his tears still puddle at the bottom of the fountain and his lost soul still visits the bridge, etching love notes to her, hoping she will return to find him.\"\n\n\"Lets go down and look,\" she said. \n\"Look for what?\" \n\"His tears.\"\n\nI looked at her mesmerized by the same fairytale and didn\'t think a second time about whether that rope and splintered swing would hold us because it didn\'t seem to matter. The only thing that I mattered was right here in front of me: beautiful, smooth, warm, soft golden strands of hair with a faint luminescence the brightened the grayness of the descending day. I didn\'t care if we ever left the damp murkiness of this fountain\'s dirt floor as long as we were together. \n\n\"Come on,\" she said, \"get on\".\n\nAnd we slowly lowered the seat to bottom.  \nI watched her look at it. Running her fingers along the archway of stone shaping the top of a heart, the aged wood exterior, cracked and warped and dark like the dirt leading up to it. In the middle, framed like a window, was a painting of a tree; tall with blossoming orange flowers. Despite how old everything was, the painting was in pristine condition. The door wasn\'t large, maybe 5 feet tall.\n\nShe knocked.   \n\"I guess no one\'s home,\" teasing me with a smile.\n\"Look, It\'s another heart,\" she said quietly, \"They really liked hearts I guess.\" \n\n\"Why are we whispering,\" I asked, holding the heart shaped lock in the palm of my hand. \n\"I don\'t know,\" she said, \"I don\'t wake the spirits,\" chuckling, \"don\'t step in his tears,\" pointing to the puddle of water I was standing in. Then raised my chin with her cold finger to her  warm lips, outlined with a light pink gloss, and kissed me three times whispering \"I - love - you,\" between each kiss and placing her hand on my chest, \"just you,\" slipping the skeleton key from around my neck which I found under the bridge earlier in the day, and slipped it into the lock\'s heart. \n\nA short click echoed against the fountain\'s circular wall and the latch fell open. They say everything happens for a reason. That people and the world around us are all connected, synchronized to live in harmony, destiny or whatever it is you believe, and our arriving at this place in this time is exactly where we are supposed to be I thought. \n\n\"Open it,\" I said touching her hand, \"it\'s time to go home.\" The wedding ring on her finger vanished in a poof of purple smoke. A ray of light cast against the ground as she pulled the door open, as a loud sucking wind chased us from behind. The Hawk screeched and flew into the sky above with a shrill cry.\n\nHolding hands we ducked our heads under the curved archway and walked into what very well could be our destiny or our greatest mistake.\n\n###3  \n__\"SO WHAT DID THEY WALK INTO,\" SHE ASKED, TAKING A SIP OF HER TEA.__  I looked into her blue eyes that were not willing to take no for an answer.\n\n\"A glimpse of their future.\"','',1415,'2015-01-23 17:34:42','2015-02-05 09:12:42',0,1,0),

This is where they would come to be alone and share their heart. I ran my finger across the heart shaped etchings on the cobblestones thinking about their conversations, listening for their laughter, picturing them sitting on a blanket under the oak tree sharing an afternoon. It felt as if I was reading the scratched hearts like braille, each with their own memory.\n\nThe hawk tilted it\'s head, looking down on her, watching her peer deep into the fountain\'s darkness. \"Don\'t fall in,\" I joked. She looked back at me smiling. The hawk tilted it\'s head back towards me, it\'s beady black eyes staring; curious, and I continued sharing my story.  \n\n\"So the story of this place,\" I said trying to recapture her attention, \"was shared with me by two widowed elderly women I met at La Dolce Vita last week.\" I watched her tug on the rope, wondering if she is listening or still lost in her world. \n\n\"Do you think it\'s odd that this is a seat and not a bucket?\" she asked. Yes, it was a little unorthodox I thought, but, \"what\'s more strange is how sturdy it appears after all these years,\" I answered. She gave it a strong yank; it appeared solid. \"I\'d sit on it,\" she said, obviously distracted to answer my own previous question. \"Yeah, why not,\" I went along, \"we may find a bunch of pennies down there.\" She looked across at me, once again interested in my words. \"For their wishes,\" I said looking down with her.\n\n\"They said the story goes like this: There were two lovers who believed they were destined to be together; he always compassionately called her an Angel God himself dropped from Heaven, but they didn\'t find one another until each was married and had children. The townspeople said he was a hopeless romantic, poet, followed his heart to a fault and the woman had beautiful, long hair, strands of gold with a nurturing heart. She was always around town, tending to her chores as a dutiful wife and was often seen at the edge of a large meadow picnicking with her son under a tall oak tree.\"\n\n\"I bet that was the tree,\" She said pointing through the fountain\'s canopy and across the field to an open space where a creek flowed under a small foot bridge. It\'s large trunk held up the towering, twisted branches with chunks of bark shedding themselves from the cold winter. I looked into her excited and happy smile, agreeing with her. \"Tell me more,\" she said connecting with my eyes.\n\n\"The townspeople said that when those two were together an aura of peace and happiness surrounded them and that their smiles would turn winter into summer as they walked by like magic.\" She smiled absorbing the nature and peace surrounding her. The hawk screeched as two black jays with white spots landed on the bridge. \"The say flowers bloomed out of nowhere in the middle of winter and tree\'s start budding. People who believed as they did, thought it was magic because only true love could have this kind miraculous power. The lovers realized that they couldn\'t have this kind of attention shadowing their every step, so they travelled into the woods and this became the place they would meet, secretly away from the town, away from the people that knew about them so they could be who they believed they were meant to be.\"\n\n\"You know,\" She broke in, \"they remind me a little of us,\" she said. \"I wonder if they carved messages to each other on the bridge, like we do?\"\n\nI smiled like she was reading my mind. \"Well, the old ladies\' at the coffee shop said the bridge is where they would leave messages to each other,\"  I chuckled, \"and other times have quiet picnics, speaking intimately without the need for words. Then one afternoon, after six years of meeting secretly the young woman found the courage and strength to want to change her life.  \n\nWhile they laid together under the oak tree she whispered in her lover\'s ear,  \"I\'m ready to change my life. Return here in ten days from tomorrow and we will leave this place and finally be together.\"\n\nHe returned to the bridge ten days later ready to run away and begin a new life with her. And he waited, and waited. The sun cut through the same winter-sleeping limbs above us and still he waited and waited until the sun fell behind the hill but she never came and he never knew why.\nThey say his tears still puddle at the bottom of the fountain and his lost soul still visits the bridge, etching love notes to her, hoping she will return to find him.\"\n\n\"Lets go down and look,\" she said. \n\"Look for what?\" \n\"His tears.\"\n\nI looked at her mesmerized by the same fairytale and didn\'t think a second time about whether that rope and splintered swing would hold us because it didn\'t seem to matter. The only thing that I mattered was right here in front of me: beautiful, smooth, warm, soft golden strands of hair with a faint luminescence the brightened the grayness of the descending day. I didn\'t care if we ever left the damp murkiness of this fountain\'s dirt floor as long as we were together. \n\n\"Come on,\" she said, \"get on\".\n\nAnd we slowly lowered the seat to bottom.  \nI watched her look at it. Running her fingers along the archway of stone shaping the top of a heart, the aged wood exterior, cracked and warped and dark like the dirt leading up to it. In the middle, framed like a window, was a painting of a tree; tall with blossoming orange flowers. Despite how old everything was, the painting was in pristine condition. The door wasn\'t large, maybe 5 feet tall.\n\nShe knocked.   \n\"I guess no one\'s home,\" teasing me with a smile.\n\"Look, It\'s another heart,\" she said quietly, \"They really liked hearts I guess.\" \n\n\"Why are we whispering,\" I asked, holding the heart shaped lock in the palm of my hand. \n\"I don\'t know,\" she said, \"I don\'t wake the spirits,\" chuckling, \"don\'t step in his tears,\" pointing to the puddle of water I was standing in. Then raised my chin with her cold finger to her  warm lips, outlined with a light pink gloss, and kissed me three times whispering \"I - love - you,\" between each kiss and placing her hand on my chest, \"just you,\" slipping the skeleton key from around my neck which I found under the bridge earlier in the day, and slipped it into the lock\'s heart. \n\nA short click echoed against the fountain\'s circular wall and the latch fell open. They say everything happens for a reason. That people and the world around us are all connected, synchronized to live in harmony, destiny or whatever it is you believe, and our arriving at this place in this time is exactly where we are supposed to be I thought. \n\n\"Open it,\" I said touching her hand, \"it\'s time to go home.\" The wedding ring on her finger vanished in a poof of purple smoke. A ray of light cast against the ground as she pulled the door open, as a loud sucking wind chased us from behind. The Hawk screeched and flew into the sky above with a shrill cry.\n\nHolding hands we ducked our heads under the curved archway and walked into what very well could be our destiny or our greatest mistake.\n\n###3  \n__\"SO WHAT DID THEY WALK INTO,\" SHE ASKED, TAKING A SIP OF HER TEA.__  I looked into her blue eyes that were not willing to take no for an answer.\n\n\"A glimpse of their future.\"','',1415,'2015-01-23 17:34:42','2015-02-05 09:12:42',0,1,0),
